## Bloom's Taxonomy Distribution

Each visual element includes explicit learning objectives tied to Bloom's 2001 Taxonomy:

- **Remembering:** 3 elements (triangle types, congruence criteria)
- **Understanding:** 16 elements (all classification types, theorems, why they work)
- **Applying:** 16 elements (all MicroSims, congruence identification, calculations)
- **Analyzing:** 13 elements (distinguishing SAS from SSA, comparing triangles, theorem proofs)
- **Evaluating:** 7 elements (verification tools, determining congruence, inequality checks)
- **Creating:** 2 elements (triangle design challenges, special segment construction)

## Special Features

### Comprehensive Triangle Coverage
This is the most extensive triangle chapter in the textbook:
- **6 classification types** (3 by sides, 3 by angles)
- **5 congruence criteria** plus 2 non-examples
- **4 major angle theorems**
- **2 inequality theorems**
- **4 special segments** with concurrent points

### Dual Classification System
Unique to triangles:
- Every triangle has TWO classifications (one by sides, one by angles)
- Interactive classifier shows both simultaneously
- Examples: "obtuse isosceles," "right scalene," "acute equilateral"
- Impossible combinations identified (right equilateral, obtuse equilateral)

### Congruence Emphasis
Building on Chapter 6:
- Triangle-specific shortcuts to proving congruence
- Emphasis on included vs. non-included parts
- Clear non-examples (AAA, SSA) with explanations
- Comprehensive practice tool with all criteria

### Theorem Proofs
Visual proofs provided:
- Triangle Sum Theorem (using parallel lines and alternate interior angles)
- Connects to Chapter 3 (angles and transversals)
- Step-by-step logical progression

### Special Segments Integration
Four concurrent points all in one chapter:
- Medians → Centroid (balance point, 2:1 division)
- Altitudes → Orthocenter (location varies by type)
- Perpendicular Bisectors → Circumcenter (equidistant from vertices)
- Angle Bisectors → Incenter (equidistant from sides)
- Equilateral triangle: all four points coincide!

### Real-World Applications
Five major application areas highlighted:
1. **Engineering** - Trusses, bridges, structural supports (rigidity)
