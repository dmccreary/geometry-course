  Design Challenges & Solutions:

  Challenge: The AREA taxonomy has 34 concepts, making it too large for a
  single chapter.
  Solution: Integrated area formulas for 2D shapes (concepts 161-172)
  naturally with their respective chapters (triangles in Chapter 7, polygons
   in Chapter 9, circles in Chapter 11), while consolidating all 3D geometry
   into Chapter 12.

  Challenge: Triangle concepts (TRI taxonomy) contain 28 concepts, which
  would create an oversized chapter.
  Solution: Split triangles into two chapters: Chapter 7 focuses on
  congruence and basic properties (22 concepts), while Chapter 8 covers the
  four triangle centers (4 concepts), creating better balance.

  Challenge: Foundational concepts appear scattered across the learning
  graph with varying dependency levels.
  Solution: Carefully sequenced Chapter 1 to include only truly foundational
   concepts (FOUND group + basic reasoning), allowing later chapters to
  build systematically.

  Challenge: Similarity concepts and right triangle trigonometry both appear
   in the SIM taxonomy but represent different complexity levels.
  Solution: Kept them together in Chapter 10 as they naturally flow from
  proportional reasoning to trigonometric ratios, with the Pythagorean
  theorem as a bridge.

  Challenge: Chapter 12 has 35 concepts, which exceeds optimal range.
  Solution: This is acceptable because: (1) many are measurement formulas
  that students apply quickly, (2) it represents the capstone/application
  phase, (3) the concepts range from straightforward (perimeter, area) to
  advanced (Cavalieri's Principle, design challenges), providing natural
  scaffolding.
