An AI-assisted geometry course that features interactive learning graphs and MicroSims (micro-simulations). This comprehensive educational resource makes geometry concepts accessible through visual, interactive demonstrations and structured learning paths.

## üéØ Features

- **Interactive MicroSims**: Visual, hands-on simulations for key geometry concepts
- **Learning Graph**: Structured dependency mapping of geometry concepts
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: 12 chapters covering fundamental to advanced topics
- **AI-Assisted Development**: Modern pedagogical approach using AI tools
- **Creative Commons License**: Open educational resource for widespread use

## üìö Course Structure

### Chapters
1. **Introduction to Geometry** - Basic concepts and angle exploration
2. **Reasoning and Proofs** - Logical thinking and geometric proofs
3. **Lines** - Properties and relationships of lines
4. **Congruent Triangles** - Triangle congruence theorems
5. **Properties of Triangles** - Special triangle properties
6. **Polygons** - Multi-sided figures and their properties
7. **Similarity** - Similar figures and proportional reasoning
8. **Right Triangles and Trigonometry** - Pythagorean theorem and trig functions
9. **Circles** - Circle properties, chords, and relationships
10. **Area and Perimeters** - Measurement of 2D figures
11. **Surface Area and Volume** - 3D figure measurements
12. **Transformations** - Geometric transformations and symmetry

### Interactive Components
