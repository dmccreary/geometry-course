By the definition of vertical angles, they are formed by two intersecting lines and are opposite each other. Let's call the other two angles \u22203 and \u22204. By the definition of a linear pair, \u22201 and \u22203 form a linear pair, as do \u22202 and \u22203. According to the Linear Pair Postulate, angles that form a linear pair are supplementary, so m\u22201 + m\u22203 = 180\u00b0 and m\u22202 + m\u22203 = 180\u00b0.

These techniques were so important to ancient Greek mathematicians that they posed famous construction challenges, some of which took millennia to solve!</p> <p>In the modern world, while we have digital tools and CAD software, understanding compass and straightedge constructions develops your spatial reasoning, problem-solving skills, and appreciation for mathematical elegance.</p>"},{"location":"chapters/04-geometric-constructions/#the-tools-of-construction","title":"The Tools of Construction","text":""},{"location":"chapters/04-geometric-constructions/#the-compass","title":"The Compass","text":"<p>A compass is a tool with two legs: one holds a pencil or marking point, and the other has a fixed point.

Because they are parallelograms, they both have all the properties of parallelograms (opposite sides parallel, opposite sides equal, opposite angles equal, consecutive angles supplementary, diagonals bisect each other) plus their own special properties.</p> <p>Concept Tested: Quadrilateral Hierarchy</p> <p>See: Chapter 9: Quadrilateral Family Hierarchy</p>"},{"location":"chapters/09-polygons-quadrilaterals/quiz/#6-what-special-property-distinguishes-a-square-from-other-rectangles","title":"6.

While all rectangles have four right angles (A), parallel opposite sides (C), and diagonals that bisect each other (D), a square is the special rectangle that also has all four sides equal in length. In fact, a square is both a rectangle (four right angles) AND a rhombus (four equal sides), making it the most special quadrilateral.</p> <p>Concept Tested: Square Properties</p> <p>See: Chapter 9: Quadrilateral Hierarchy</p>"},{"location":"chapters/09-polygons-quadrilaterals/quiz/#7-what-is-the-sum-of-the-interior-angles-of-a-hexagon","title":"7.

Using the interior angle sum formula S = (n-2) \u00d7 180\u00b0, where n = 6 for a hexagon: S = (6-2) \u00d7 180\u00b0 = 4 \u00d7 180\u00b0 = 720\u00b0. A hexagon can be divided into 4 triangles from one vertex, and since each triangle has 180\u00b0 of angles, the total is 4 \u00d7 180\u00b0 = 720\u00b0.

For a regular pentagon (n = 5), each interior angle = (n-2) \u00d7 180\u00b0 / n = (5-2) \u00d7 180\u00b0 / 5 = 3 \u00d7 180\u00b0 / 5 = 540\u00b0 / 5 = 108\u00b0. Since a regular pentagon has all angles equal, we divide the total interior angle sum (540\u00b0) by the number of angles (5) to get 108\u00b0 for each angle.

In a parallelogram, opposite angles are congruent (equal in measure). This means if angle A measures 70\u00b0, then angle C (opposite to A) also measures 70\u00b0.

The three basic **trigonometric ratios** are:  1. **Sine (sin)** 2. **Cosine (cos)** 3. **Tangent (tan)**  Each ratio compares two sides of a right triangle relative to one of the acute angles.  ### The Three Trigonometric Ratios  For any acute angle \u03b8 (theta) in a right triangle:  #### Sine Ratio Formula  $\\sin(\\theta) = \\frac{\\text{opposite}}{\\text{hypotenuse}}$  where:  - $\\theta$ is an acute angle in the right triangle - opposite is the side opposite to angle $\\theta$ - hypotenuse is the longest side (opposite the right angle)  #### Cosine Ratio Formula  $\\cos(\\theta) = \\frac{\\text{adjacent}}{\\text{hypotenuse}}$  where:  - $\\theta$ is an acute angle in the right triangle - adjacent is the side next to angle $\\theta$ (not the hypotenuse) - hypotenuse is the longest side  #### Tangent Ratio Formula  $\\tan(\\theta) = \\frac{\\text{opposite}}{\\text{adjacent}}$  where:  - $\\theta$ is an acute angle in the right triangle - opposite is the side opposite to angle $\\theta$ - adjacent is the side next to angle $\\theta$  ### SOH-CAH-TOA: The Trigonometry Memory Aid  A popular way to remember these ratios is **SOH-CAH-TOA**:  - **SOH**: Sine = Opposite / Hypotenuse - **CAH**: Cosine = Adjacent / Hypotenuse - **TOA**: Tangent = Opposite / Adjacent  #### Diagram: Trigonometric Ratios Visualization  Trigonometric Ratios in a Right Triangle Type: diagram  Learning Objective: Students will identify and label the opposite, adjacent, and hypotenuse sides relative to a given angle, and calculate the three basic trigonometric ratios (Bloom's: Remembering, Understanding, Applying).  Purpose: Clear labeled diagram showing a right triangle with all three trigonometric ratios defined for one angle.  Components: - Right triangle with vertices labeled A (right angle), B, C - Angle \u03b8 (theta) at vertex B - Three sides clearly labeled:   - Hypotenuse (side BC) = 5   - Opposite (side AC, opposite to \u03b8) = 3   - Adjacent (side AB, adjacent to \u03b8) = 4 - Right angle mark at vertex A  Annotations with calculations: - sin(\u03b8) = opposite/hypotenuse = 3/5 = 0.6 - cos(\u03b8) = adjacent/hypotenuse = 4/5 = 0.8 - tan(\u03b8) = opposite/adjacent = 3/4 = 0.75  Visual elements: - Color-code each side: opposite (red), adjacent (blue), hypotenuse (green) - Arc showing angle \u03b8 - \"SOH-CAH-TOA\" reminder in a box - Arrows pointing from each ratio to its corresponding sides  Style: Clean, educational diagram with clear labels Color scheme: Bright, distinct colors for each side type  Implementation: Static diagram or interactive p5.js where students can change the angle   #### Drawing: Trigonometric Ratios Explorer  Trigonometric Ratios Explorer MicroSim Type: microsim  Learning Objective: Students will create right triangles with different angles and observe how sine, cosine, and tangent values change, developing intuition about trigonometric functions (Bloom's: Applying, Analyzing).

Identify which side you know and which side you want to find 2. Choose the trig ratio that relates those two sides 3. Set up an equation 4. Solve for the unknown side  **Example:** A ladder leans against a wall at a 70\u00b0 angle with the ground. If the ladder is 10 feet long, how high up the wall does it reach?  - Known: angle = 70\u00b0, hypotenuse = 10 ft - Unknown: opposite side (height) - Ratio: sin(70\u00b0) = opposite/hypotenuse  $\\sin(70\u00b0) = \\frac{h}{10}$  $h = 10 \\cdot \\sin(70\u00b0) \u2248 10 \\cdot 0.94 = 9.4 \\text{ feet}$  ## Inverse Trigonometric Functions  Sometimes we know the sides of a right triangle but need to find an angle. That's where **inverse trigonometric functions** come in!  The three inverse trig functions are:  - $\\sin^{-1}$ (or arcsin): finds the angle when you know opposite and hypotenuse - $\\cos^{-1}$ (or arccos): finds the angle when you know adjacent and hypotenuse - $\\tan^{-1}$ (or arctan): finds the angle when you know opposite and adjacent  **Note:** The $-1$ is not an exponent! $\\sin^{-1}$ does not mean $\\frac{1}{\\sin}$. It means \"inverse sine.\"  **Example:** A ramp has a horizontal length of 12 feet and a height of 3 feet. What angle does it make with the ground?  $\\tan(\\theta) = \\frac{3}{12} = 0.25$  $\\theta = \\tan^{-1}(0.25) \u2248 14\u00b0$  #### Drawing: Inverse Trig Function Solver  Inverse Trig Function Solver MicroSim Type: microsim  Learning Objective: Students will apply inverse trigonometric functions to find unknown angles in right triangles given two sides, reversing the typical trigonometry problem (Bloom's: Applying, Analyzing).  Purpose: Interactive tool where students input two sides of a right triangle and the simulation finds all angles.

These angles are commonly used in surveying, navigation, and architecture.  #### Diagram: Angles of Elevation and Depression  Angles of Elevation and Depression Type: diagram  Learning Objective: Students will differentiate between angles of elevation and depression, understanding their geometric relationship as alternate interior angles (Bloom's: Understanding, Analyzing).

How tall is the building?  Set up a right triangle:  - Adjacent side = 50 feet (distance from building) - Opposite side = h (height of building) - Angle = 60\u00b0  Use tangent:  $\\tan(60\u00b0) = \\frac{h}{50}$  $h = 50 \\cdot \\tan(60\u00b0) \u2248 50 \\cdot 1.732 = 86.6 \\text{ feet}$  ## Indirect Measurement  **Indirect measurement** means finding a distance or height without measuring it directly. This is incredibly useful when you can't physically measure something\u2014like the height of a mountain or the width of a river!  Trigonometry and similar triangles make indirect measurement possible.  ### Methods of Indirect Measurement  1. **Similar triangles method**: Create a smaller similar triangle that you can measure 2. **Trigonometry method**: Measure an angle and one distance, then use trig ratios 3. **Shadow method**: Use shadows and proportions on a sunny day  #### Drawing: Shadow Method Indirect Measurement  Shadow Method Indirect Measurement MicroSim Type: microsim  Learning Objective: Students will apply similar triangle concepts and proportional reasoning to solve real-world indirect measurement problems, creating their own measurement scenarios (Bloom's: Applying, Creating).

If it's enlarged with a scale factor of 2.5, what are the new dimensions?  3. **Geometric Mean**: Find the geometric mean of 12 and 27.  4. **Pythagorean Theorem**: A right triangle has legs of 7 cm and 24 cm. Find the hypotenuse.  5. **Triangle Classification**: Determine if a triangle with sides 10, 11, and 15 is right, acute, or obtuse.  6. **Distance Formula**: Find the distance between points (-3, 2) and (5, 8).  7. **Trigonometry**: In a right triangle, if the hypotenuse is 20 and one angle is 40\u00b0, find the length of the side opposite the 40\u00b0 angle.  8. **Inverse Trig**: A ramp rises 2 feet over a horizontal distance of 10 feet. What angle does it make with the ground?  9. **Angle of Elevation**: From 150 feet away, the angle of elevation to the top of a building is 32\u00b0. How tall is the building (ignore eye height)?  10. **Indirect Measurement**: A 6-foot person casts a 4-foot shadow. At the same time, a tree casts a 26-foot shadow. How tall is the tree?  ## Looking Ahead  In the next chapter, we'll explore **polygons and quadrilaterals** in depth, examining special properties of parallelograms, rectangles, rhombuses, and trapezoids. You'll use your knowledge of similarity and trigonometry to analyze these shapes and solve problems involving their angles, sides, and diagonals.  The concepts you've learned in this chapter\u2014especially proportional reasoning and the Pythagorean theorem\u2014will continue to be essential tools throughout the rest of your geometry studies and beyond!"},{"location":"chapters/10-similarity-trigonometry/quiz/","title":"Quiz: Similarity and Right Triangle Trigonometry","text":"<p>Test your understanding of similar figures, the Pythagorean theorem, and trigonometric ratios with these questions.</p>"},{"location":"chapters/10-similarity-trigonometry/quiz/#1-two-figures-are-similar-if-they-have","title":"1.

If two triangles have all three angles equal, they are similar by AA (Angle-Angle) similarity. Since the angle sum in any triangle is 180\u00b0, if two angles match, the third angle must also match.

A minor arc has a measure less than 180\u00b0. A major arc has a measure greater than 180\u00b0. A semicircle has a measure of exactly 180\u00b0. Since 120\u00b0 &lt; 180\u00b0, this is a minor arc. The classification depends only on the arc's angle measure, not on the circle's radius (which only affects the arc's length, not its type). Option B would require an angle &gt; 180\u00b0.

An inscribed angle that intercepts a semicircle (180\u00b0 arc) measures 90\u00b0 because the inscribed angle is always half the measure of the intercepted arc: (1/2) \u00d7 180\u00b0 = 90\u00b0.

Sector area = (\u03b8/360\u00b0) \u00d7 \u03c0r\u00b2. Since both sectors have the same angle (45\u00b0), the ratio of their areas depends only on r\u00b2.

Is this possible?
