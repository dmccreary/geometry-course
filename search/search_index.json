What is the measure of the angle?</p> </li> <li> <p>Answer: 80\u00b0, because 180\u00b0 - 100\u00b0 = 80\u00b0</p> </li> <li> <p>Why does an angle measuring 90\u00b0 have no complement?</p> </li> <li> <p>Answer: Because the complement would be 0\u00b0, and an angle of 0\u00b0 does not make sense in this context. Complementary angles must both be greater than 0\u00b0 and add up to 90\u00b0.</p> </li> <li> <p>Is it possible for an obtuse angle to have a complement? Explain why or why not.</p> </li> <li> <p>Answer: No, because obtuse angles measure more than 90\u00b0, and complementary angles must add up to 90\u00b0. Therefore, an obtuse angle cannot have a complement.</p> </li> <li> <p>Using the MicroSim, at what angle measure does the supplement become \"None\"? What does this signify?</p> </li> <li> <p>Answer: At 180\u00b0, the supplement becomes \"None\". This signifies that an angle measuring 180\u00b0 is a straight angle and does not have a supplement because there is no angle that can be added to it to reach 180\u00b0, as it already measures 180\u00b0.</p> </li> <li> <p>If two angles are supplementary and one angle measures x\u00b0, express the other angle in terms of x.</p> </li> <li> <p>Answer: The other angle measures (180\u00b0 - x)\u00b0.</p> </li> <li> <p>Using the MicroSim, find two angles that are both complementary and supplementary. Is this possible? Explain your reasoning.</p> </li> <li> <p>Answer: It is not possible for two angles to be both complementary and supplementary because complementary angles add up to 90\u00b0, while supplementary angles add up to 180\u00b0.
