According to the Linear Pair Postulate, angles that form a linear pair are supplementary, so m\u22201 + m\u22203 = 180\u00b0 and m\u22202 + m\u22203 = 180\u00b0. By the Transitive Property of Equality, since both sums equal 180\u00b0, we can write m\u22201 + m\u22203 = m\u22202 + m\u22203. Using the Subtraction Property of Equality, we subtract m\u22203 from both sides to get m\u22201 = m\u22202.

Complementary angles must both be greater than 0\u00b0 and add up to 90\u00b0.</p> </li> <li> <p>Is it possible for an obtuse angle to have a complement? Explain why or why not.</p> </li> <li> <p>Answer: No, because obtuse angles measure more than 90\u00b0, and complementary angles must add up to 90\u00b0. Therefore, an obtuse angle cannot have a complement.</p> </li> <li> <p>Using the MicroSim, at what angle measure does the supplement become \"None\"? What does this signify?</p> </li> <li> <p>Answer: At 180\u00b0, the supplement becomes \"None\". This signifies that an angle measuring 180\u00b0 is a straight angle and does not have a supplement because there is no angle that can be added to it to reach 180\u00b0, as it already measures 180\u00b0.</p> </li> <li> <p>If two angles are supplementary and one angle measures x\u00b0, express the other angle in terms of x.</p> </li> <li> <p>Answer: The other angle measures (180\u00b0 - x)\u00b0.</p> </li> <li> <p>Using the MicroSim, find two angles that are both complementary and supplementary. Is this possible? Explain your reasoning.</p> </li> <li> <p>Answer: It is not possible for two angles to be both complementary and supplementary because complementary angles add up to 90\u00b0, while supplementary angles add up to 180\u00b0.

There is a single slider that changes the angle of a line in a circle at the center of the drawing area.  As the slider moves, the line rotates around the circle.
