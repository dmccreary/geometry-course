A flat vector cartoon illustration of a friendly owl character named Geowise, a pedagogical mascot for a high school geometry textbook. Geowise is a round, plump great horned owl with soft purple-gray plumage on his back and wings, a cream-colored chest with subtle feather texture, and warm orange-amber eyes that convey curiosity and kindness. He wears small round gold-rimmed glasses perched on his beak and a tiny orange knit scarf loosely draped around his neck. He has prominent ear tufts with purple-gray tips. His expression is a gentle, encouraging smile with slightly raised eyebrows suggesting curiosity. He stands upright at a slight angle, one wing raised in a friendly wave, the other wing holding a small silver compass (the geometric drawing tool). His talons are small and rounded, standing on a faint dotted line suggesting a geometric baseline. The overall proportions are chibi-style — large head relative to body, compact and icon-friendly. The color palette uses purple (#7b1fa2) and orange (#ff9800) accents to match the textbook's theme. Style: modern flat vector illustration with clean outlines, minimal shading, solid color fills, suitable for use as a small icon in educational materials. White background. No text in image.
