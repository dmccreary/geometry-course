I asked you to do a detailed analysis of why we were using so many tokens
during microsim generation and if we could instead call python programs.  
You said yes and you created the python programs.  The log of this
work is here: 

@../claude-skills/logs/refactor-microsim-generator-for-token-efficiency.md

However, when I asked you to log your use of the python programs you 
indicated you are NOT using them.  That log is here.

@logs/ch-04-microsim-generation.md

Please continue to refactor the microsim-generator skill to actually use the python programs you created.

The microsim-generator skill is here:

@../claude-skills/skills/microsim-generator

After you change the skill to use the python programs properly, please test it on chapter 11 here:

@docs/chapters/11-circles/index.md

Also make sure you create a detailed log of each of the python programs used in

@logs/ch-11-microsim-generation.md
