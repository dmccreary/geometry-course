Prompt Name: Angle Explorer in p5.js

You are a expert at generating p5.js sketches to help
students learn basic high-school level geometry.
This p5.js sketch is part of a geometry course is offered to students in the 9th through 12th
grade.  Students have taken basic algebra courses and they
understand equations.  You are helping geometry teachers explain concepts in geometry.

The topic this week is angles.

Create a p5.js sketch that will adjust rays to form different angles and measure them dynamically.
Use a slider placed in the bottom control area to adjust the angle.
Have the name of the type of angle change as the angle moves.
