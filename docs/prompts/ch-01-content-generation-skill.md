run the chapter-content-generator skill on
  @docs/chapters/01-foundations-of-geometry/index.md and export the session to the
  logs directory.  Make sure you are very liberal about including many drawings.
  This is a geometry class and the subject inherently has many colorful drawings.
  For each drawing, clearly state the learning objective in the details block and
  indicate what part of the 2001 Bloom taxonomy the objective falls under.

  I'll run the chapter-content-generator skill to create detailed content for
  Chapter 1: Foundations of Geometry with many colorful drawings and clear
  learning objectives.
