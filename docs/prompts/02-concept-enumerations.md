## Workflow

**Breaking down concepts**

I'm listing 150 core geometry concepts for a high-school course, using short names and abbreviations. The list is numbered, each concept clearly labeled.

**Unveiling core concepts**

I'm detailing fundamental geometry concepts, including points, lines, triangles, polygons, circles, coordinate geometry, transformations, and solid geometry. Each topic will be expanded to identify at least 150 individual concepts.

**Identifying geometric terms**

I'm working through various geometric concepts such as angles, triangles, and congruence through the exploration of terms like acute, obtuse, right, and straight angles, as well as different types of triangles and their properties.

**Examining geometric shapes**

I'm mapping out the study of various geometric forms, ranging from triangles like 45-45-90 and 30-60-90, to quadrilaterals such as parallelograms, rectangles, and trapezoids, each with their unique properties.

**Breaking down math insights**

I'm outlining a comprehensive list of 150 concepts in geometry, including various solids and their properties, geometric constructions, logical reasoning, proof types, and specific triangle properties.
