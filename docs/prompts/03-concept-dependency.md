# Concept Dependency

## Prompt

```linenums="0"
That was very good.
Let's call the number in front of each concept the ConceptID
and the string after the number the "ConceptLabel".

Now our next step is to create a precise concept learning dependency
graph.  For each concept, create a list of other concepts
that must be understood before that concept can be mastered.

Return a CSV file that has the following format:

- Column 1 is the ConceptID from the list above
- Column 2 is the ConceptLabel from the list above
- Column 3 is the Dependencies.  It is a pipe-delimited list of the ConceptIDs that this concept depends on.

Foundation concepts don't depend on any other concepts.  Their Dependencies is empty.  Some of  initial introductory concepts are foundation concepts.
There must be at least one concept that depends on a foundation concept.
Make sure each concept is connected to the graph in some way.
```

## Workflow

**Crafting the CSV file**

I'm preparing to generate a CSV file with three crucial columns: ConceptID, ConceptLabel, and Dependencies. Foundation concepts have empty Dependencies, some initial concepts are foundations, and each concept links to the graph.

**Mapping dependencies**

I'm organizing 150 concepts into a CSV file, linking each concept to its ConceptID and listing dependencies using pipe-delimited ConceptIDs.

**Ensuring logical progression**

I'm making sure each cell in the CSV file aligns with geometric concepts. Dependencies must progress logically, forming a cohesive and connected graph.

**Categorizing concepts**

I'm mapping out the concepts and identifying how they link together. Next, I'll group them under broader topics for clarity and organization.

**Mapping geometric concepts**

I'm piecing together geometric terms like interior and exterior angles, triangles, congruence, similarity, polygon properties, and circle terms such as radius, diameter, chord, and tangent.

Organizing geometry topics

**Deciphering foundation concepts**

I'm identifying foundational geometric concepts like point, line, plane, segment, ray, and collinear points. Understanding angles might require grasping rays first.

I'm mapping out foundational concepts and their dependencies. Foundational concepts include Point, Line, and Plane. Segment and Ray might be foundational or dependent.

**Shaping the structure**

OK, let me see. I'm working through the CSV rows, pinpointing relationships and nurturing foundational concepts. Progress is steady, making it a rewarding journey.

**Understanding geometric relationships**

I'm mapping out how various geometric concepts depend on types of angles and lines. This exploration highlights the connections between angles, bisectors, and directional lines.

Mapping connections

**Identifying dependencies**

I'm organizing various triangle types and geometric properties by pinpointing key dependencies, such as congruent triangles, segments, and angles, while tracking the progression towards specific geometric conclusions.

**Analyzing geometric relationships**

I'm examining various geometric shapes, including rectangles, squares, triangles, and quadrilaterals, and their relationships with parallel and perpendicular lines, focusing on properties and theorems.

**Mapping relationships**

I'm gathering info on how concepts like diameter and radius interact within circles, then linking them to elements such as chords, tangents, and secants.

**Connecting geometric concepts**

I'm linking the concepts of perpendicular lines, reflection, rotation, translation, dilation, and transformation to their respective formulas and symmetries, creating a cohesive understanding of geometric principles.

**Mapping concepts**

I'm piecing together how concepts like component form, solid geometry, and surface area or volume depend on each other and on prior concepts, creating a logical interconnected structure of knowledge.

Incorporating foundational and specific concepts, the pyramid and cone volumes intrigue me, as do cross sections and Euler's formula. Properties of congruent and similar figures deepen the exploration of geometric principles.

**Compiling dependencies**

I'm working through organizing concepts in a CSV file, detailing each concept's dependencies with ConceptIDs. The goal is to create a structured, informative document for clarity and understanding.

**Synthesizing geometric terms**

Piecing together the geometric terms and concepts, I'm focusing on points, lines, planes, angles, and polygons. Each term is linked to corresponding properties and theorems, forming a comprehensive geometric glossary.

**Revisiting transformations**

I'm rethinking the role of Transformation as a foundational idea, given that it involves mapping figures to others, which requires prior knowledge.
