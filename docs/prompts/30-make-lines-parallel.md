 [Image #1] Use the microsim-p5 skill to create a new MicroSim called `make-these-lines-parallel`.  In this MicroSim a user is 
presented with a 10x10 grid like in the image.  On this grid are two intersecting lines.  One line is fixed, and has two points on it
 that can't be moved by the user.  The other line has one fixed point, but the other poing is red and can be moved by the user.  When
 they move the red point, it will snap to a grid line.  There is a button in the right called "Check".  When the user clicks the 
"Check" button, it will calculate the slop of the line that has been changed.  If the slope is the same the program says "Correct!" 
in green.  If the slope of the two lines is NOT the same, the button will show "Incorrect.  Try Again".  The check button will 
trigger a green line slowly moving from the moving line to the other fixed line.  This animation takes about 2 seconds. 

Check the logic to make sure the use can solve the problem.
