# Welcome

Welcome to our website for an AI assisted high school geometry course.

This website is designed to show how generative AI can work
with knowledge graphs to create personalized learning plans
for a typical high school geometry course.

This course also demonstrates how generative AI can be used
to create interactive animations and simulations using
[MicroSims](https://dmccreary.github.io/microsims/).
MicroSims are small simulations of the real world
that demonstrate learning concepts.  They can
be created and modified using generative AI tools
such as ChatGPT.


Please contact me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/danmccreary/) if you
have any questions about this course.

Thanks! - Dan
