   - Low priority: more Analyze/Evaluate

3. **Structure:**
   - Clear, searchable question phrasing
   - Standalone answer (no external context required)
   - Links to relevant chapter sections
   - Examples for abstract concepts

4. **Alignment:**
   - Matches learning graph concept
   - Connects to existing FAQ questions where relevant
   - Uses consistent terminology from glossary

## Conclusion

The current FAQ covers 130/200 concepts (65%) with excellent quality. Adding the recommended 70 questions in three phases will:

1. **Phase 1 (24 questions):** Close critical gaps → 77% coverage
2. **Phase 2 (28 questions):** Comprehensive coverage → 91% coverage
3. **Phase 3 (18 questions):** Complete coverage → 100% coverage

**Highest Priority Actions:**
1. Add triangle congruence theorem questions (SSS, SAS, ASA, AAS, HL, CPCTC)
2. Add triangle property theorem questions (Sum, Exterior Angle, Inequality)
3. Add basic area and volume formula questions
4. Add triangle center questions (centroid, incenter, circumcenter, orthocenter)

These additions will transform the FAQ from "good" (65% coverage) to "excellent" (77% coverage) and eventually to "comprehensive" (100% coverage), supporting students throughout their entire geometry journey.
