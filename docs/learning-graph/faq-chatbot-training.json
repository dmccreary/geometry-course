      "question": "What is this geometry course about?",
      "answer": "This is a comprehensive high school geometry course (grades 9-10) that explores shapes, space, and structure through interactive simulations (MicroSims), hands-on geometric constructions, and real-world design challenges. The course covers everything from basic geometric terms and logical reasoning to advanced topics like coordinate geometry, transformations, trigonometry, and 3D solids. You'll learn to reason like a mathematician by discovering geometric relationships through visual MicroSims, proving why those relationships are true, and applying them creatively to solve meaningful design and modeling problems.",

You'll use dynamic geometry tools to move shapes, watch transformations, explore triangles and circles in 3D, and model real-world objects. The course connects geometric ideas to real applications—from honeycombs to roller coasters, from kaleidoscopes to architecture.

Deductive reasoning starts with accepted facts (postulates, definitions, theorems) and uses logic to reach a conclusion that must be true. Example - Inductive: Observe 2+4=6, 8+12=20, conclude sum of evens is even (seems true but not proven). Example - Deductive: Given all rectangles have four right angles and ABCD is a rectangle, conclude ABCD has four right angles (guaranteed true).

Example: If two angles are vertical, then they are congruent. Hypothesis: two angles are vertical. Conclusion: they are congruent.
