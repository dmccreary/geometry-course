# Quiz: Similarity and Right Triangle Trigonometry

Test your understanding of similar figures, the Pythagorean theorem, and trigonometric ratios with these questions.

#### 1. Two figures are similar if they have:

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. The same area
2. The same shape but not necessarily the same size
3. The same perimeter
4. The same number of right angles
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. Similar figures have the same shape but not necessarily the same size. This means corresponding angles are congruent (equal) and corresponding sides are proportional (have the same ratio). Similar figures can be enlargements or reductions of each other. Options A and C are incorrect because similar figures can have different areas and perimeters. Option D is incorrect because similarity doesn't require right angles.

#### 2. What does the mnemonic "SOH-CAH-TOA" help you remember?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. The Pythagorean theorem
2. Triangle congruence criteria
3. The three trigonometric ratios (sine, cosine, tangent)
4. The distance formula
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **C**. SOH-CAH-TOA is a memory aid for the three basic trigonometric ratios: SOH (Sine = Opposite / Hypotenuse), CAH (Cosine = Adjacent / Hypotenuse), TOA (Tangent = Opposite / Adjacent). This mnemonic helps students remember which sides to use for each trigonometric function in a right triangle.

#### 3. If two triangles are similar with a scale factor of 3, and the original triangle has an area of 8 square units, what is the area of the scaled triangle?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. 24 square units
2. 72 square units
3. 64 square units
4. 11 square units
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. When figures are scaled by a factor k, the area scales by k². With a scale factor of 3, the area multiplies by 3² = 9. So the scaled area = 8 × 9 = 72 square units. Option A incorrectly multiplies by k instead of k². Option C uses k² but with the wrong calculation. Option D adds instead of multiplying.

#### 4. A right triangle has legs of length 5 and 12. What is the length of the hypotenuse?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. 7
2. 13
3. 17
4. 60
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. Using the Pythagorean theorem: a² + b² = c², we have 5² + 12² = c². This gives 25 + 144 = c², so 169 = c², and c = 13. This is the famous 5-12-13 Pythagorean triple. Option A (7) is the difference, not the hypotenuse. Option C would be for different leg lengths. Option D is the product, not the hypotenuse.

#### 5. Two triangles have angles measuring 40°, 60°, and 80°. Can you conclude they are similar?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. No, you need to know the side lengths
2. Yes, by AA similarity (two angles determine the third)
3. Only if they are both right triangles
4. Only if they have the same perimeter
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. If two triangles have all three angles equal, they are similar by AA (Angle-Angle) similarity. Since the angle sum in any triangle is 180°, if two angles match, the third angle must also match. These triangles have identical angles (40°, 60°, 80°), so they are definitely similar, regardless of their size. Option A is incorrect—angle equality is sufficient for similarity. Options C and D impose unnecessary conditions.

#### 6. In a right triangle, if you know the lengths of the opposite side and adjacent side relative to an angle θ, which trigonometric ratio would you use to find the angle?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. sin⁻¹ (inverse sine)
2. cos⁻¹ (inverse cosine)
3. tan⁻¹ (inverse tangent)
4. All three would work equally well
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **C**. The tangent ratio relates opposite and adjacent sides: tan(θ) = opposite/adjacent. To find the angle when you know opposite and adjacent, use the inverse tangent: θ = tan⁻¹(opposite/adjacent). Options A and B would require knowing the hypotenuse in addition to one leg. Option D is incorrect because each inverse function requires specific sides.

#### 7. A triangle has sides of length 7, 24, and 25. Using the converse of the Pythagorean theorem, what type of triangle is this?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Acute triangle
2. Right triangle
3. Obtuse triangle
4. Cannot be determined
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. Check: 7² + 24² = 49 + 576 = 625, and 25² = 625. Since 7² + 24² = 25² (where 25 is the longest side), the triangle is a right triangle by the converse of the Pythagorean theorem. This is the 7-24-25 Pythagorean triple. If the sum of squares was greater than 25², it would be acute. If less than 25², it would be obtuse.

#### 8. In a right triangle with angle θ = 30°, the sine of θ is 0.5. What does this tell you about the relationship between the opposite side and the hypotenuse?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. The opposite side is half the length of the hypotenuse
2. The opposite side is twice the length of the hypotenuse
3. The opposite side equals the hypotenuse
4. The opposite side is 0.5 units long
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **A**. Since sin(θ) = opposite/hypotenuse = 0.5 = 1/2, the opposite side is half the length of the hypotenuse. If the hypotenuse is 10 units, the opposite side would be 5 units. This ratio holds for any 30° angle in a right triangle. Option B reverses the relationship. Option C would require sin(θ) = 1. Option D confuses the ratio with an actual length.

#### 9. Two similar triangles have corresponding side lengths in the ratio 2:5. If the smaller triangle has a perimeter of 24 cm, what is the perimeter of the larger triangle?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. 48 cm
2. 60 cm
3. 96 cm
4. 120 cm
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. When triangles are similar, all corresponding measurements (including perimeter) scale by the same factor. The scale factor is 5/2 = 2.5. So the larger triangle's perimeter = 24 × 2.5 = 60 cm. Alternatively, if the ratio is 2:5, then 24:x = 2:5, giving x = (24 × 5)/2 = 60 cm. Option A doubles instead of using the correct ratio. Options C and D use incorrect calculations.

#### 10. A surveyor stands 50 meters from the base of a building and measures the angle of elevation to the top as 60°. Approximately how tall is the building? (Use tan(60°) ≈ 1.73)

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. 29 meters
2. 50 meters
3. 87 meters
4. 100 meters
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **C**. Using the tangent ratio: tan(60°) = height/distance, so height = 50 × tan(60°) = 50 × 1.73 ≈ 86.5 ≈ 87 meters. The 50-meter distance is the adjacent side, and the building height is the opposite side relative to the 60° angle. Option A uses the wrong operation. Option B would be correct only if the angle were 45°. Option D doubles incorrectly.
