# Similarity and Right Triangle Trigonometry

## Summary

This chapter develops proportional reasoning through similarity transformations and similarity criteria for triangles, then introduces the Pythagorean theorem and trigonometric ratios for solving right triangles. You'll learn how similar figures relate through scale factors, apply the Pythagorean theorem to find distances, and use sine, cosine, and tangent to solve real-world problems involving angles of elevation, angles of depression, and indirect measurement.
