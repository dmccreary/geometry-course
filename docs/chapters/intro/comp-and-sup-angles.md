**Lesson Plan: Understanding Complementary and Supplementary Angles Using the MicroSim**

* * * *

### **Objective**

-   To help students visualize and understand the concepts of complementary and supplementary angles.
-   To enable students to interactively explore how angles relate to each other through the MicroSim tool.
-   To assess students' comprehension of angle relationships using the interactive simulation.

* * * *

### **Materials Needed**

-   Computers or tablets with internet access.
-   The MicroSim p5.js sketch for Complementary and Supplementary Angles.

### **Lesson Outline**

#### **1\. Introduction (10 minutes)**

-   Begin with a brief review of basic angle concepts.
    -   Define an angle and how it is measured in degrees.
    -   Introduce the terms:
        -   **Complementary Angles**: Two angles whose measures add up to 90°.
        -   **Supplementary Angles**: Two angles whose measures add up to 180°.
-   Explain the importance of understanding these angle relationships in geometry.

#### **2\. Demonstration of the MicroSim (5 minutes)**

-   Project the MicroSim onto a screen for the whole class to see.
-   Walk through the features of the MicroSim:
    -   **Slider Control**: Adjusts the angle from 0° to 180°.
    -   **Visual Representation**: Shows the angle with moving rays and labels.
    -   **Angle Name Display**: Identifies the type of angle based on its measure.
    -   **Complement and Supplement Display**: Calculates and displays the complement and supplement of the angle, if applicable.

#### **3\. Guided Exploration (15 minutes)**

-   Instruct students to access the MicroSim on their devices.
-   Ask them to adjust the slider and observe:
    -   How the angle changes visually.
    -   How the angle name changes (e.g., acute, right, obtuse).
    -   The calculations of the complement and supplement.
-   Pose the following questions for students to consider:
    -   What happens to the complement as the angle increases?
    -   At what angle does the complement become "None" or "N/A"?
    -   How does the supplement change as the angle approaches 180°?
-   Encourage students to take notes on their observations.

#### **4\. Interactive Activities (20 minutes)**

-   **Activity 1: Finding Complements**
    -   Set the angle to various measures less than 90°.
    -   Record the angle and its complement.
    -   Verify that the sum equals 90°.
-   **Activity 2: Finding Supplements**
    -   Set the angle to various measures less than 180°.
    -   Record the angle and its supplement.
    -   Verify that the sum equals 180°.
-   **Activity 3: Special Angles**
    -   Identify what happens at 90° and 180°.
    -   Discuss why the complement or supplement is "None" at these angles.
-   **Activity 4: Angle Classification**
    -   Categorize angles based on their measures:
        -   Acute (0° < angle < 90°)
        -   Right (angle = 90°)
        -   Obtuse (90° < angle < 180°)
        -   Straight (angle = 180°)

#### **5\. Class Discussion (10 minutes)**

-   Bring the class back together to discuss findings.
-   Ask volunteers to share their observations and conclusions.
-   Clarify any misconceptions and reinforce key concepts.

#### **6\. Sample Assessment (10 minutes)**

-   Distribute or display the following questions for students to answer individually.

### **Sample Assessment Questions**

1.  **If an angle measures 30°, what is its complement and supplement?**

    -   **Answer**:
        -   Complement: 60°
        -   Supplement: 150°
2.  **An angle has a supplement that measures 100°. What is the measure of the angle?**

    -   **Answer**: 80°, because 180° - 100° = 80°
3.  **Why does an angle measuring 90° have no complement?**

    -   **Answer**: Because the complement would be 0°, and an angle of 0° does not make sense in this context. Complementary angles must both be greater than 0° and add up to 90°.
4.  **Is it possible for an obtuse angle to have a complement? Explain why or why not.**

    -   **Answer**: No, because obtuse angles measure more than 90°, and complementary angles must add up to 90°. Therefore, an obtuse angle cannot have a complement.
5.  **Using the MicroSim, at what angle measure does the supplement become "None"? What does this signify?**

    -   **Answer**: At 180°, the supplement becomes "None". This signifies that an angle measuring 180° is a straight angle and does not have a supplement because there is no angle that can be added to it to reach 180°, as it already measures 180°.
6.  **If two angles are supplementary and one angle measures x°, express the other angle in terms of x.**

    -   **Answer**: The other angle measures (180° - x)°.
7.  **Using the MicroSim, find two angles that are both complementary and supplementary. Is this possible? Explain your reasoning.**

    -   **Answer**: It is not possible for two angles to be both complementary and supplementary because complementary angles add up to 90°, while supplementary angles add up to 180°. No two angles can satisfy both conditions simultaneously.

### **Conclusion**

-   Summarize the key takeaways from the lesson.
    -   Complementary angles add up to 90°.
    -   Supplementary angles add up to 180°.
    -   The MicroSim is a useful tool for visualizing and understanding these concepts.
-   Encourage students to explore the MicroSim further at home to reinforce their understanding.

### **Homework (Optional)**

-   Assign problems from the textbook related to complementary and supplementary angles.
-   Ask students to create their own angle problems and solve them using the MicroSim.

**Note to Students**: The MicroSim is an interactive way to see how angles work together. By adjusting the slider, you can see in real-time how changing one angle affects its complement and supplement. Use this tool to deepen your understanding and have fun exploring the world of geometry!
