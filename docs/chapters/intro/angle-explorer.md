**Grade Level:** 9th - 12th Grade Geometry

## Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:

-  Understand and identify different types of angles: zero, acute, right, obtuse, and straight angles.
-  Use the Angle Explorer MicroSim to manipulate rays and observe how angle measures change dynamically.
-  Relate angle measures to their corresponding angle types.
-  Apply their understanding of angles to solve problems and recognize angles in real-world contexts.

## Key Concepts

- **Angle Measurement:** An angle is formed by two rays (sides) sharing a common endpoint (vertex). Angles are measured in degrees (°), ranging from 0° to 180° in this context.

- **Types of Angles:**

-   **Zero Angle (0°):** The rays overlap completely; there is no opening between them.
-   **Acute Angle (0° < angle < 90°):** An angle smaller than a right angle; the rays form a sharp point.
-   **Right Angle (90°):** An angle that forms a perfect "L" shape; the rays are perpendicular.
-   **Obtuse Angle (90° < angle < 180°):** An angle larger than a right angle but less than a straight angle.
-   **Straight Angle (180°):** The rays extend in opposite directions, forming a straight line.
-   **Dynamic Visualization:** Using interactive tools to manipulate geometric figures helps deepen understanding of geometric concepts.

-   **Obtuse Angles (91° - 179°):**

    -   **Activity:** Change the angle to 120°.
    -   **Observation:** Examine how obtuse angles differ from acute angles.
    -   **Question:** What real-world objects have obtuse angles?

-   **Straight Angle (180°):**

    -   **Activity:** Set the angle to 180°.
    -   **Observation:** The rays form a straight line.
    -   **Question:** How does a straight angle relate to a straight line?

### 4. Interactive Challenges (20 minutes)

-   **Challenge 1: Angle Identification**

    -   **Task:** Adjust the slider to find examples of each angle type.
    -   **Record:** For each angle type, note the angle measure and draw a sketch.
    -   **Share:** Discuss findings with a partner or small group.

-   **Challenge 2: Real-Life Connections**

    -   **Task:** Think of real-life examples that match each angle type.
    -   **Examples:**
        -   Acute Angle: A slice of pie.
        -   Right Angle: Corner of a book.
        -   Obtuse Angle: The hands of a clock at 10:10.
    -   **Share:** Present examples to the class.

### 5. Concept Application (15 minutes)

-   **Problem-Solving Activity:**

    -   **Scenario:** Using the MicroSim, imagine designing a piece of art that incorporates different angle types.
    -   **Task:** Create a plan that includes at least one of each angle type.
    -   **Explain:** Write a brief description of how each angle will be used in your design.

-   **Reflection Questions:**

    -   How does changing the angle measure affect the classification of the angle?
    -   What patterns do you notice as the angle increases from 0° to 180°?

## Things for Students to Try with the MicroSim

1.  **Exact Measures:**

Set the angle to specific measures (15°, 45°, 75°, etc.) and identify the angle type.

2.  **Transitional Angles:**

-   Observe what happens when the angle changes from 89° to 90°, and from 90° to 91°.
-   **Question:** How does the angle type classification change at these points?

3.  **Angle Sum Exploration:**
