#### 1. What is the definition of a point in geometry?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. A location in space with length but no width
2. A specific location in space with no size
3. A small dot with measurable diameter
4. The intersection of two lines
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. A point represents a specific location in space with no length, width, or thickness—it exists purely as a position. Points have zero dimensions. Option A is incorrect because points have no length. Option C is incorrect because points have no measurable size. Option D describes one way points can be formed but is not the definition.

    **Concept Tested:** Point

    **See:** [Chapter 1: Points](index.md#point)

#### 2. Which statement correctly describes the difference between a line and a line segment?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. A line has endpoints, while a line segment extends infinitely
2. A line extends infinitely in both directions, while a line segment has two endpoints
3. A line is curved, while a line segment is straight
4. A line has measurable length, while a line segment does not
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. A line extends infinitely in both directions (shown with arrows), while a line segment has two definite endpoints and measurable length. Option A reverses the correct definitions. Option C is incorrect because both are straight. Option D is incorrect because line segments have measurable length, not lines.

    **Concept Tested:** Line vs Line Segment

    **See:** [Chapter 1: Line and Line Segment](index.md#line-segment)

#### 3. What are collinear points?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Points that lie in the same plane
2. Points that form a circle
3. Points that all lie on the same line
4. Points that are equidistant from a center
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **C**. Collinear points are points that all lie on the same line. Any two points are always collinear, but three or more points may or may not be collinear. Option A describes coplanar points, not collinear. Options B and D describe specific geometric arrangements but not collinearity.

    **Concept Tested:** Collinear Points

    **See:** [Chapter 1: Collinear Points](index.md#collinear-points)

#### 4. If you observe that 2+4=6, 8+10=18, and 12+14=26 are all even numbers, and conclude "the sum of any two even numbers is always even," what type of reasoning are you using?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Deductive reasoning
2. Inductive reasoning
3. Algebraic reasoning
4. Coordinate reasoning
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. Inductive reasoning starts with specific examples, identifies a pattern, and makes a general conjecture. You observed specific cases and generalized to all even numbers. Deductive reasoning (A) starts with general principles and applies them to specific cases. Options C and D are not types of logical reasoning related to making conjectures.

    **Concept Tested:** Inductive Reasoning

    **See:** [Chapter 1: Inductive Reasoning](index.md#inductive-reasoning)

---

#### 5. What is a counterexample?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. An example that supports a conjecture
2. A specific example that proves a conjecture is false
3. The opposite of a mathematical theorem
4. A statement that cannot be proven
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. A counterexample is a specific example that shows a conjecture is false. Finding just one counterexample is enough to disprove a conjecture completely. Option A describes a supporting example, not a counterexample. Option C confuses counterexample with logical opposites. Option D describes unprovable statements, which is different.

    **Concept Tested:** Counterexample

    **See:** [Chapter 1: Counterexample](index.md#counterexample)

#### 6. Which geometric objects can be skew lines?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Two lines in the same plane that never intersect
2. Two lines in different planes that never intersect
3. Two lines that intersect at a right angle
4. Two parallel lines
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. Skew lines are non-coplanar lines that never intersect—they exist in different planes and are not parallel. Option A describes parallel lines (which must be coplanar). Option C describes perpendicular lines. Option D describes parallel lines, which cannot be skew because parallel lines must be in the same plane.

    **Concept Tested:** Skew Lines

    **See:** [Chapter 1: Skew Lines](index.md#skew-lines)

#### 7. Given that "all rectangles have four right angles" and "ABCD is a rectangle," what can you conclude using deductive reasoning?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Some rectangles might not have right angles
2. ABCD might have four right angles
3. ABCD definitely has four right angles
4. You need more information to conclude anything
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **C**. Deductive reasoning uses general principles (all rectangles have four right angles) to reach certain conclusions about specific cases (ABCD is a rectangle). Therefore, ABCD definitely has four right angles. Option A contradicts the given statement. Option B suggests uncertainty when deduction provides certainty. Option D is incorrect because we have sufficient information.

    **Concept Tested:** Deductive Reasoning

    **See:** [Chapter 1: Deductive Reasoning](index.md#deductive-reasoning)

#### 8. What is the midpoint of a line segment?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. The endpoint with the smallest coordinate value
2. The point that divides the segment into two equal parts
3. The point closest to the origin
4. Any point on the segment
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. The midpoint of a line segment is the point that divides the segment into two congruent (equal length) parts—it's exactly halfway between the endpoints. Every segment has exactly one midpoint. Options A and C describe specific points based on coordinates but not the midpoint definition. Option D is too general—most points on a segment are not the midpoint.

    **Concept Tested:** Midpoint

    **See:** [Chapter 1: Midpoint](index.md#midpoint)

---

#### 9. If points A, B, and C lie in plane M, and points A, B, and C also lie in plane N, what can you conclude about planes M and N?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Planes M and N are parallel
2. Planes M and N are perpendicular
3. Planes M and N are the same plane
4. Planes M and N intersect at a line
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **C**. Through any three non-collinear points, there exists exactly one plane (a fundamental postulate). Since points A, B, and C determine both plane M and plane N, M and N must be the same plane. If the points were collinear, option D could be possible, but the question doesn't specify. Options A and B would require the planes to be distinct, which contradicts the postulate.

    **Concept Tested:** Plane Properties

    **See:** [Chapter 1: Plane](index.md#plane)

---

#### 10. What do perpendicular lines form at their intersection?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Two acute angles
2. Two obtuse angles
3. Four right angles
4. Two right angles and two obtuse angles
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **C**. Perpendicular lines intersect at a right angle (90°), which creates four right angles at the intersection point. All four angles measure exactly 90°. Options A, B, and D are incorrect because when two lines intersect at 90°, all four angles formed must be 90° (supplementary and vertical angle relationships ensure this).

    **Concept Tested:** Perpendicular Lines

    **See:** [Chapter 1: Perpendicular Lines](index.md#perpendicular-lines)
