# Triangle Congruence and Properties

## Summary

This chapter studies triangle classifications, congruence criteria (SSS, SAS, ASA, AAS, HL), important theorems about triangle angles and sides, and special segments within triangles. You'll learn when and how to prove triangles congruent and apply triangle properties to solve problems. Understanding these fundamental triangle relationships is essential for working with more complex polygons and for proving geometric theorems throughout the course.
