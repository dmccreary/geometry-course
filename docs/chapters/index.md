# Chapters

This textbook is organized into 12 chapters covering 200 concepts in high school geometry.

## Chapter Overview

1. [Foundations of Geometry](01-foundations-of-geometry/index.md) - Introduces undefined terms, basic geometric objects, and fundamental reasoning skills needed for all future work in geometry.

2. [Logic and Proof](02-logic-and-proof/index.md) - Develops formal reasoning skills through conditional statements, logical equivalence, and various proof techniques.

3. [Angles and Angle Relationships](03-angles-and-relationships/index.md) - Explores angle classifications, special angle pairs, and relationships formed when lines intersect.

4. [Geometric Constructions](04-geometric-constructions/index.md) - Teaches compass and straightedge construction techniques for creating precise geometric figures.

5. [Coordinate Geometry and Lines](05-coordinate-geometry/index.md) - Bridges algebra and geometry by exploring lines in the coordinate plane.

6. [Transformations and Congruence](06-transformations-congruence/index.md) - Introduces geometric transformations and explores how rigid motions define congruence.

7. [Triangle Congruence and Properties](07-triangle-congruence/index.md) - Studies triangle classifications, congruence criteria, and important theorems.

8. [Triangle Centers and Advanced Topics](08-triangle-centers/index.md) - Explores the four classical triangle centers formed by special segments.

9. [Polygons and Quadrilaterals](09-polygons-quadrilaterals/index.md) - Extends triangle concepts to polygons with special focus on quadrilaterals.

10. [Similarity and Right Triangle Trigonometry](10-similarity-trigonometry/index.md) - Develops proportional reasoning through similarity and introduces trigonometric ratios.

11. [Circles](11-circles/index.md) - Explores circles including their parts, angle relationships, and arc measures.

12. [Area, Volume, and Applications](12-area-volume-applications/index.md) - Applies geometric principles to measurement and real-world modeling challenges.

## How to Use This Textbook

Progress through the chapters sequentially, as each chapter builds on concepts from previous chapters. The learning graph respects all prerequisite dependencies, ensuring you have the necessary foundation before encountering more advanced topics. Each chapter includes interactive MicroSims and hands-on activities to deepen your understanding of geometric relationships.
