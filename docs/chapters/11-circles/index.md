# Circles

## Summary

This chapter explores circles including their parts (chords, tangents, secants), angle relationships (central and inscribed angles), arc measures, and equations in the coordinate plane. You'll learn important theorems about angles formed by chords, tangents, and secants, and discover how to calculate arc lengths and sector areas. The chapter culminates in writing equations of circles and working with inscribed and circumscribed polygons.
