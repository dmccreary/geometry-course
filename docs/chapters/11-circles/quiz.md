#### 1. A line that touches a circle at exactly one point is called:

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. A secant
2. A chord
3. A tangent
4. A diameter
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **C**. A tangent is a line that touches the circle at exactly one point called the point of tangency. An important property of tangents is that they are always perpendicular to the radius drawn to the point of tangency. A secant (A) intersects the circle at two points. A chord (B) is a segment with both endpoints on the circle. A diameter (D) is the longest chord passing through the center.

#### 2. What is the relationship between the diameter and radius of a circle?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. The diameter is half the radius
2. The diameter equals the radius
3. The diameter is twice the radius
4. The diameter is the square of the radius
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **C**. The diameter of a circle is always twice the radius: d = 2r. The diameter is the longest chord of a circle and passes through the center, connecting two points on the circle. If a circle has a radius of 5 cm, its diameter is 10 cm. Option A reverses the relationship. Option B would only be true for r = 0. Option D confuses multiplication with squaring.

#### 3. An inscribed angle measures 40°. What is the measure of the central angle that intercepts the same arc?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. 20°
2. 40°
3. 80°
4. 160°
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **C**. The Inscribed Angle Theorem states that an inscribed angle measures half the central angle that intercepts the same arc. If the inscribed angle is 40°, then the central angle = 2 × 40° = 80°. Conversely, the inscribed angle is always half the corresponding central angle. Option A reverses the relationship. Option B would only be true if both angles were equal (which they're not). Option D doubles twice instead of once.

    **Concept Tested:** Inscribed Angle Theorem

    **See:** [Chapter 11: Angles in Circles](index.md#angles-in-circles)

#### 4. If a circle has a radius of 10 cm and a central angle of 90°, what is the length of the arc intercepted by this angle? (Use π ≈ 3.14)

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. 5π cm ≈ 15.7 cm
2. 10π cm ≈ 31.4 cm
3. 15π cm ≈ 47.1 cm
4. 20π cm ≈ 62.8 cm
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **A**. Using the arc length formula: L = (θ/360°) × 2πr = (90°/360°) × 2π(10) = (1/4) × 20π = 5π ≈ 15.7 cm. A 90° angle is one-quarter of the full circle, so the arc length is one-quarter of the circumference (2πr = 20π). Option B is the full semicircle length. Option C doesn't match any calculation. Option D is the full circumference.

#### 5. A tangent line to a circle forms what type of angle with the radius drawn to the point of tangency?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. An acute angle (less than 90°)
2. A right angle (exactly 90°)
3. An obtuse angle (greater than 90°)
4. The angle varies depending on the circle
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. A fundamental property of tangent lines is that a tangent is always perpendicular to the radius at the point of tangency, forming a 90° (right) angle. This property is true for all circles, regardless of their size. This perpendicular relationship is frequently used in circle proofs and problems. Options A, C, and D are incorrect—the angle is always exactly 90°.

#### 6. If two chords in a circle have different lengths, which statement is true about their distances from the center?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. The longer chord is farther from the center
2. The longer chord is closer to the center
3. Both chords are equidistant from the center
4. Distance from center doesn't relate to chord length
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. In a circle, the longer a chord is, the closer it is to the center. The longest possible chord is the diameter, which passes directly through the center (distance = 0). As chords get shorter, they move farther from the center. This is because the perpendicular distance from the center to a chord determines how much of the circle's diameter that chord "captures." Option A reverses this relationship.

#### 7. A sector of a circle has a central angle of 60° and the circle has a radius of 12 cm. What is the area of the sector? (Use π ≈ 3.14)

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. 12π cm² ≈ 37.7 cm²
2. 24π cm² ≈ 75.4 cm²
3. 36π cm² ≈ 113.1 cm²
4. 144π cm² ≈ 452.4 cm²
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. Using the sector area formula: A = (θ/360°) × πr² = (60°/360°) × π(12)² = (1/6) × 144π = 24π ≈ 75.4 cm². A 60° angle is one-sixth of the full circle, so the sector area is one-sixth of the total circle area (πr² = 144π). Option A uses only the radius, not r². Option C is one-quarter of the circle. Option D is the full circle area.

#### 8. An arc measures 120°. Is this arc classified as a minor arc, major arc, or semicircle?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Minor arc
2. Major arc
3. Semicircle
4. Cannot be determined without the radius
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **A**. A minor arc has a measure less than 180°. A major arc has a measure greater than 180°. A semicircle has a measure of exactly 180°. Since 120° < 180°, this is a minor arc. The classification depends only on the arc's angle measure, not on the circle's radius (which only affects the arc's length, not its type). Option B would require an angle > 180°. Option C requires exactly 180°.

    **Concept Tested:** Arc Classification

    **See:** [Chapter 11: Arcs and Arc Measure](index.md)

#### 9. If an inscribed angle intercepts a semicircle (an arc of 180°), what is the measure of the inscribed angle?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. 45°
2. 60°
3. 90°
4. 180°
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **C**. An inscribed angle that intercepts a semicircle (180° arc) measures 90° because the inscribed angle is always half the measure of the intercepted arc: (1/2) × 180° = 90°. This is a special case of the Inscribed Angle Theorem and means that any angle inscribed in a semicircle is a right angle. This property is useful for constructing right angles. Option D would be the arc measure, not the inscribed angle.

#### 10. Compare two circles: Circle A has radius 5 cm, and Circle B has radius 10 cm. If both circles have sectors with the same central angle of 45°, how do the sector areas compare?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Circle B's sector area is twice Circle A's sector area
2. Circle B's sector area is three times Circle A's sector area
3. Circle B's sector area is four times Circle A's sector area
4. The sector areas are equal because the angles are equal
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **C**. Sector area = (θ/360°) × πr². Since both sectors have the same angle (45°), the ratio of their areas depends only on r². Circle B's radius is twice Circle A's radius (10/5 = 2), so Circle B's sector area is 2² = 4 times larger. If Circle A's sector area is A, then Circle B's sector area is 4A because (10)² = 4 × (5)². Option A confuses linear scaling with area scaling. Option D ignores the radius squared term.
