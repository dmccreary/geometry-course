# Chapter 4: Congruent Triangles

Learn the criteria for triangle congruence, such as SSS, SAS, ASA, AAS, and HL. Apply these criteria to prove triangles are congruent in various geometric scenarios.

**MicroSims:**

- **Triangle Congruence Tester**: Adjust side lengths and angles to test for congruence.
- **SSS and SAS Simulator**: Visualize how different congruence postulates work.
