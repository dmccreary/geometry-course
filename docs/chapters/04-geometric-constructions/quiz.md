# Quiz: Geometric Constructions

Test your understanding of compass and straightedge constructions with these questions.

---

#### 1. What tools are used in classical geometric constructions?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Ruler and protractor
2. Compass and straightedge
3. Calculator and computer
4. Graph paper and pencil
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. Classical geometric constructions use only a compass (for drawing circles and arcs) and a straightedge (for drawing straight lines). These tools cannot measure distances or angles—they're for construction only. A ruler (A) measures distances, which isn't allowed. Options C and D are modern tools not used in classical constructions.

    **Concept Tested:** Compass and Straightedge

    **See:** [Chapter 4: Tools for Constructions](index.md#compass-construction)

#### 2. To copy a segment, what is the first step?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Measure the segment with a ruler
2. Draw a ray with one endpoint
3. Calculate the segment's length
4. Draw a perpendicular line
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. To copy a segment, first draw a ray with one endpoint (where the copied segment will begin). Then use a compass to measure the original segment's length and mark that distance on the new ray. Option A uses measurement, which isn't allowed in compass-and-straightedge constructions. Options C and D are not initial steps for copying segments.

    **Concept Tested:** Copying a Segment

    **See:** [Chapter 4: Copying a Segment](index.md#copying-a-segment)

#### 3. What does it mean to bisect a segment?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. To draw a parallel segment
2. To divide it into two equal parts
3. To extend it infinitely
4. To rotate it 180 degrees
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. To bisect a segment means to divide it into two congruent (equal length) parts. The bisector intersects the segment at its midpoint. Option A describes a different construction. Option C describes extending a ray. Option D describes a rotation transformation.

    **See:** [Chapter 4: Bisecting a Segment](index.md#bisecting-a-segment)

#### 4. A perpendicular bisector of a segment is:

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. A line parallel to the segment
2. A line perpendicular to the segment at its midpoint
3. A circle with radius equal to the segment
4. An angle bisector
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. A perpendicular bisector is a line (or segment or ray) that is perpendicular to a segment at its midpoint. It divides the segment into two equal parts and forms 90° angles. Option A describes parallel lines. Option C describes a construction tool. Option D refers to angles, not segments.

    **Concept Tested:** Perpendicular Bisector

    **See:** [Chapter 4: Perpendicular Bisector](index.md#constructing-perpendiculars)

---

#### 5. To construct an angle bisector, you need arcs from:

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. The vertex only
2. The endpoints of the angle only
3. The vertex and points on each ray
4. Outside the angle
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **C**. To bisect an angle, you draw an arc from the vertex that intersects both rays of the angle, creating two points. Then you draw arcs from these two points. The intersection of these arcs determines the angle bisector. Option A is incomplete. Option B refers to segment endpoints, not angle rays. Option D doesn't provide the correct construction method.

#### 6. Which construction creates a line through a point perpendicular to a given line?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Copying a segment
2. Bisecting an angle
3. Constructing perpendiculars
4. Copying an angle
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **C**. Constructing perpendiculars creates a line through a given point that is perpendicular (forms 90° angles) to a given line. This is a fundamental construction used in many geometric problems. Options A, B, and D are different construction techniques that don't create perpendicular lines.

    **See:** [Chapter 4: Constructing Perpendiculars](index.md#constructing-perpendiculars)

#### 7. Why are compass and straightedge constructions important in geometry?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. They are the fastest method
2. They prove geometric relationships exist
3. They require advanced technology
4. They only work for simple shapes
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. Compass and straightedge constructions prove that certain geometric relationships and figures can be created using only logical steps, without measurement. This demonstrates the logical foundations of geometry. Option A is incorrect—constructions can be time-consuming. Option C is wrong—these are basic tools. Option D is incorrect—constructions work for complex figures too.

    **See:** [Chapter 4: Introduction](index.md)

#### 8. To construct parallel lines, you typically:

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Draw two lines at random
2. Copy corresponding angles created by a transversal
3. Bisect a segment
4. Draw perpendicular bisectors
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. To construct parallel lines, you draw a transversal through the given line and point, then copy the angle formed. Since corresponding angles are congruent when lines are parallel, copying the angle creates a parallel line. Options A, C, and D don't guarantee parallel lines.

    **Concept Tested:** Constructing Parallels

    **See:** [Chapter 4: Constructing Parallels](index.md#constructing-parallels)

#### 9. When copying an angle, the compass width must:

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Equal the angle measure in degrees
2. Stay constant for the first arc from each vertex
3. Change between each step
4. Be as large as possible
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. When copying an angle, you keep the compass width constant when drawing the initial arcs from both the original angle's vertex and the new vertex. This ensures the arcs intersect the rays at comparable positions. Option A confuses compass width with angle measurement. Options C and D would create incorrect copies.

#### 10. The perpendicular bisector of a segment contains all points that are:

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Closer to one endpoint than the other
2. Equidistant from both endpoints
3. On the segment itself
4. Outside the segment
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. The perpendicular bisector of a segment is the set of all points that are equidistant (the same distance) from both endpoints. This is a fundamental property used in many geometric proofs and constructions. Options A, C, and D don't describe the perpendicular bisector's defining property.
