# Geometric Constructions

## Summary

This chapter teaches compass and straightedge construction techniques for creating precise geometric figures and exploring mathematical relationships. You'll learn classical construction methods passed down from ancient Greek mathematicians, including how to copy segments and angles, bisect figures, and construct parallel and perpendicular lines. These hands-on techniques develop spatial reasoning and provide concrete demonstrations of geometric theorems.

## Concepts Covered

This chapter covers the following 11 concepts from the learning graph:

1. Segment Bisector
2. Perpendicular Bisector
3. Compass Construction
4. Straightedge Construction
5. Copying a Segment
6. Copying an Angle
7. Bisecting a Segment
8. Bisecting an Angle
9. Constructing Perpendiculars
10. Constructing Parallels
11. Parallel Postulate

## Prerequisites
