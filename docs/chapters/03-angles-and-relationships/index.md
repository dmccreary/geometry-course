# Angles and Angle Relationships

## Summary

This chapter explores angle classifications, special angle pairs, and the relationships formed when lines intersect or are cut by transversals. You'll learn to identify and work with complementary angles, supplementary angles, vertical angles, and the various angle pairs created by parallel lines and transversals. These angle relationships form the foundation for proving important theorems about parallel lines, triangles, and polygons in later chapters.

## Concepts Covered

This chapter covers the following 14 concepts from the learning graph:

1. Acute Angle
2. Right Angle
3. Obtuse Angle
4. Straight Angle
5. Complementary Angles
6. Supplementary Angles
7. Adjacent Angles
8. Vertical Angles
9. Linear Pair
10. Angle Bisector
11. Corresponding Angles
12. Alternate Interior Angles
13. Alternate Exterior Angles
14. Same-Side Interior Angles
