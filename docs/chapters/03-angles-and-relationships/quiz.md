# Quiz: Angles and Angle Relationships

Test your understanding of angle classifications, special angle pairs, and parallel lines with transversals.

#### 1. An angle that measures 125° is classified as:

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Acute
2. Right
3. Obtuse
4. Straight
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **C**. An obtuse angle measures greater than 90° but less than 180°. Since 125° falls in this range, it's obtuse. Acute angles (A) measure less than 90°. Right angles (B) measure exactly 90°. Straight angles (D) measure exactly 180°.

    **Concept Tested:** Obtuse Angle

    **See:** [Chapter 3: Angle Classifications](index.md#obtuse-angles)

#### 2. Two angles are complementary. If one angle measures 35°, what is the measure of the other angle?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. 35°
2. 55°
3. 145°
4. 325°
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. Complementary angles have measures that add up to 90°. Since one angle is 35°, the other must be 90° - 35° = 55°. Option A would make them congruent, not complementary. Option C (145°) would make them supplementary (add to 180°). Option D results from incorrect arithmetic.

    **Concept Tested:** Complementary Angles

    **See:** [Chapter 3: Complementary Angles](index.md#complementary-angles)

#### 3. What is always true about vertical angles?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. They are adjacent
2. They are congruent
3. They are supplementary
4. They form a linear pair
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. The Vertical Angles Theorem states that vertical angles are always congruent (equal measure). Vertical angles are opposite angles formed when two lines intersect. They are not adjacent (A) because they don't share a side. They may or may not be supplementary (C). They don't form a linear pair (D)—adjacent angles form linear pairs.

    **Concept Tested:** Vertical Angles

    **See:** [Chapter 3: Vertical Angles](index.md#vertical-angles)

#### 4. Two angles form a linear pair. If one angle measures 72°, what is the measure of the other angle?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. 18°
2. 72°
3. 108°
4. 288°
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **C**. Angles in a linear pair are supplementary, meaning they add up to 180°. If one angle is 72°, the other must be 180° - 72° = 108°. Option A (18°) would make them complementary, not supplementary. Option B would make them congruent. Option D results from incorrect calculation.

    **Concept Tested:** Linear Pair

    **See:** [Chapter 3: Linear Pairs](index.md#linear-pairs)

#### 5. When a transversal intersects two parallel lines, which angle pair is always congruent?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Same-side interior angles
2. Corresponding angles
3. Linear pair angles
4. Adjacent angles
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. When a transversal crosses two parallel lines, corresponding angles (angles in the same relative position at each intersection) are congruent. Same-side interior angles (A) are supplementary, not congruent. Linear pairs (C) and adjacent angles (D) are not necessarily created by parallel lines and transversals.

    **Concept Tested:** Corresponding Angles

    **See:** [Chapter 3: Corresponding Angles](index.md#corresponding-angles)

---

#### 6. What is an angle bisector?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. A line that intersects an angle at any point
2. A ray that divides an angle into two congruent angles
3. A line perpendicular to an angle's sides
4. The vertex of an angle
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. An angle bisector is a ray that divides an angle into two congruent (equal) angles. Each resulting angle measures half the original angle. Option A is too general—any line can intersect an angle. Option C describes perpendicular lines, not angle bisectors. Option D defines a point, not a ray.

    **Concept Tested:** Angle Bisector

    **See:** [Chapter 3: Angle Bisectors](index.md#angle-bisectors)

#### 7. Two angles are supplementary. If one is three times the measure of the other, what is the measure of the smaller angle?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. 30°
2. 45°
3. 60°
4. 90°
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. Let the smaller angle be x. Then the larger angle is 3x. Since they're supplementary: x + 3x = 180°, so 4x = 180°, giving x = 45°. The smaller angle is 45° and the larger is 135° (which equals 3 × 45°). Options A, C, and D don't satisfy the condition that one angle is three times the other while summing to 180°.

    **Concept Tested:** Supplementary Angles (problem-solving)

    **See:** [Chapter 3: Supplementary Angles](index.md#supplementary-angles)

#### 8. In the diagram where parallel lines are cut by a transversal, if angle 1 measures 110°, what is the measure of the alternate interior angle to angle 1?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. 70°
2. 80°
3. 110°
4. 250°
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **C**. When parallel lines are cut by a transversal, alternate interior angles are congruent. Therefore, the alternate interior angle to angle 1 also measures 110°. Option A (70°) would be the supplementary angle. Options B and D don't follow from alternate interior angle relationships.

    **Concept Tested:** Alternate Interior Angles

    **See:** [Chapter 3: Alternate Interior Angles](index.md#alternate-interior-angles)

---

#### 9. What is true about same-side interior angles when parallel lines are cut by a transversal?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. They are congruent
2. They are supplementary
3. They are complementary
4. They are vertical angles
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. Same-side interior angles (also called consecutive interior angles) are supplementary—they add up to 180°. This is different from other angle pairs formed by parallel lines and transversals, which are typically congruent. Options A, C, and D describe other angle relationships that don't apply to same-side interior angles.

    **Concept Tested:** Same-Side Interior Angles

    **See:** [Chapter 3: Same-Side Interior Angles](index.md#same-side-interior-angles)

---

#### 10. Adjacent angles must always share:

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Only a common vertex
2. Only a common side
3. A common vertex and a common side
4. The same angle measure
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **C**. Adjacent angles must share both a common vertex (the corner point) and a common side (one ray between them), and they cannot overlap. Sharing only a vertex (A) or only a side (B) is insufficient. They don't need to have the same measure (D)—that would make them congruent, which is a separate property.

    **Concept Tested:** Adjacent Angles

    **See:** [Chapter 3: Adjacent Angles](index.md#adjacent-angles)
