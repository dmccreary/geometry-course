# Polygons and Quadrilaterals

## Summary

This chapter extends triangle concepts to polygons with special focus on quadrilaterals and their unique properties. You'll learn to classify quadrilaterals by their sides and angles, prove relationships between different types of quadrilaterals, and explore angle sums in polygons. The chapter also introduces regular polygons and tessellations, connecting geometry to patterns found in nature and art.

## Concepts Covered

This chapter covers the following 16 concepts from the learning graph:

1. Polygon
2. Regular Polygon
3. Interior Angles of Polygon
4. Exterior Angles of Polygon
5. Quadrilateral
6. Parallelogram
7. Rectangle
8. Rhombus
9. Square
10. Trapezoid
11. Isosceles Trapezoid
12. Kite
13. Pentagon
14. Hexagon
15. Octagon
16. Tessellation
