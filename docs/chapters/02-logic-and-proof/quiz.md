#### 1. In the conditional statement "If two angles are vertical, then they are congruent," which part is the hypothesis?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. They are congruent
2. Two angles are vertical
3. If and then
4. Vertical angles
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. In a conditional statement "If p, then q," the hypothesis is the "if" part (p). Here, "two angles are vertical" is the condition that must be true. Option A is the conclusion (the "then" part). Option C refers to the logical connectors, not the hypothesis. Option D is incomplete—it doesn't express the full hypothesis.

#### 2. What is the contrapositive of the statement "If a figure is a square, then it has four right angles"?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. If a figure has four right angles, then it is a square
2. If a figure is not a square, then it does not have four right angles
3. If a figure does not have four right angles, then it is not a square
4. A figure is a square if and only if it has four right angles
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **C**. The contrapositive switches the hypothesis and conclusion AND negates both: "If not q, then not p." The contrapositive is always logically equivalent to the original statement. Option A is the converse (switch only). Option B is the inverse (negate only). Option D is a biconditional statement.

    **Concept Tested:** Contrapositive

    **See:** [Chapter 2: Contrapositive](index.md#related-conditional-statements)

#### 3. What is the key difference between a postulate and a theorem?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Postulates are proven; theorems are accepted without proof
2. Postulates are accepted without proof; theorems must be proven
3. Postulates are about lines; theorems are about angles
4. Postulates are modern; theorems are ancient
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. Postulates (or axioms) are basic statements accepted as true without proof—they're the foundational assumptions. Theorems are statements that must be proven using postulates, definitions, and previously proven theorems. Option A reverses the definitions. Options C and D make incorrect distinctions based on content or time period.

    **Concept Tested:** Postulate vs Theorem

    **See:** [Chapter 2: Postulates and Theorems](index.md#postulates-and-theorems)

#### 4. Which proof format organizes statements in the left column and reasons in the right column?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Paragraph proof
2. Flow chart proof
3. Two-column proof
4. Indirect proof
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **C**. Two-column proofs organize statements on the left and their justifications (reasons) on the right, making the logical flow clear and easy to follow. Paragraph proofs (A) present arguments in essay form. Flow chart proofs (B) use boxes and arrows. Indirect proofs (D) refer to proof by contradiction, not a format.

    **Concept Tested:** Two-Column Proof

    **See:** [Chapter 2: Two-Column Proof](index.md#two-column-proof)

#### 5. In an indirect proof, what is the first step?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. State the given information
2. Assume the opposite of what you want to prove
3. Draw a diagram
4. Apply the Pythagorean Theorem
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. Indirect proof (proof by contradiction) begins by assuming the opposite (negation) of what you want to prove, then showing this assumption leads to a contradiction. Option A is important but comes before assuming the opposite. Option C is helpful but not the defining first step of indirect proof. Option D is a specific technique unrelated to indirect proof structure.

#### 6. Given the statement "If it rains, then the ground is wet," which of the following is the converse?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. If it does not rain, then the ground is not wet
2. If the ground is wet, then it rained
3. If the ground is not wet, then it did not rain
4. It rains if and only if the ground is wet
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. The converse switches the hypothesis and conclusion: "If q, then p." Here, the converse is "If the ground is wet, then it rained." Note that the converse is NOT necessarily true (the ground could be wet from a sprinkler). Option A is the inverse. Option C is the contrapositive. Option D is a biconditional.

    **Concept Tested:** Converse

    **See:** [Chapter 2: Converse](index.md#related-conditional-statements)

---

#### 7. What makes a biconditional statement true?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Only the original conditional must be true
2. Only the converse must be true
3. Both the conditional and its converse must be true
4. The contrapositive must be false
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **C**. A biconditional statement ("p if and only if q") is true when both directions are true: the original conditional (if p, then q) AND its converse (if q, then p). This creates a two-way logical connection. Options A and B are insufficient—both directions are required. Option D is incorrect because the contrapositive is equivalent to the original conditional.

    **Concept Tested:** Biconditional Statement

    **See:** [Chapter 2: Biconditional Statements](index.md#biconditional-statements)

#### 8. Which property justifies the step "If x + 5 = 12, then x = 7" in an algebraic proof?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Addition Property of Equality
2. Subtraction Property of Equality
3. Multiplication Property of Equality
4. Reflexive Property of Equality
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. To go from x + 5 = 12 to x = 7, we subtract 5 from both sides. The Subtraction Property of Equality states that if a = b, then a - c = b - c. The Addition Property (A) would add to both sides. The Multiplication Property (C) would multiply both sides. The Reflexive Property (D) states that a = a.

    **Concept Tested:** Properties of Equality

    **See:** [Chapter 2: Properties Used in Proofs](index.md#key-properties-used-in-proofs)

#### 9. A coordinate proof would be most useful for proving which of the following?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. The sum of angles in a triangle is 180°
2. The diagonals of a rectangle are congruent
3. Vertical angles are congruent
4. All radii of a circle are congruent
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. Coordinate proofs use algebra and the coordinate plane to prove geometric properties. Proving the diagonals of a rectangle are congruent works well by placing the rectangle on a coordinate plane and using the distance formula. Option A is better proven with angle relationships. Option C is better proven with linear pairs. Option D follows from the definition of a circle.

    **Concept Tested:** Coordinate Proof

    **See:** [Chapter 2: Coordinate Proof](index.md#coordinate-proof)

#### 10. If you want to prove a statement is true and direct proof seems very difficult, which proof technique should you consider?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Two-column proof
2. Paragraph proof
3. Indirect proof
4. Coordinate proof
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **C**. Indirect proof (proof by contradiction) is often useful when direct proof is difficult. You assume the opposite of what you want to prove and show it leads to a contradiction, thereby proving the original statement. Options A and B are formats, not techniques for handling difficult proofs. Option D (coordinate proof) is a specific approach for geometric figures on the plane, not a general technique for difficult proofs.
