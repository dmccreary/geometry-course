# Transformations and Congruence

## Summary

This chapter introduces geometric transformations as functions that move shapes in the plane while exploring how rigid motions (translations, rotations, and reflections) define congruence. You'll learn that two figures are congruent if and only if one can be mapped onto the other through a sequence of rigid transformations. This modern approach to congruence provides a dynamic, visual understanding of why figures have the same size and shape.

## Concepts Covered

This chapter covers the following 12 concepts from the learning graph:

1. Translation

8. Composition of Transformations
9. Congruent Figures
10. Corresponding Parts
11. Triangle Congruence
12. CPCTC
