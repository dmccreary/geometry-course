# Triangle Centers and Advanced Topics

## Summary

This chapter explores the four classical triangle centers—the centroid, orthocenter, circumcenter, and incenter—formed by the intersection of special segments and lines in triangles. You'll discover the unique properties of each center and learn how they relate to triangle geometry. These centers have fascinating geometric properties and practical applications in fields ranging from engineering to art.
