# Quiz: Triangle Centers and Advanced Topics

Test your understanding of the four classical triangle centers and their properties with these questions.

#### 1. The centroid of a triangle is the point where:

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. The three angle bisectors intersect
2. The three medians intersect
3. The three altitudes intersect
4. The three perpendicular bisectors intersect
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. The centroid is the intersection point of the three medians. A median connects a vertex to the midpoint of the opposite side. The centroid is also the balance point of the triangle—where it would balance if cut from uniform cardboard. Option A describes the incenter, option C describes the orthocenter, and option D describes the circumcenter.

#### 2. Which triangle center is formed by the intersection of the angle bisectors?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Centroid
2. Circumcenter
3. Orthocenter
4. Incenter
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **D**. The incenter is the point where the three angle bisectors intersect. An angle bisector divides an angle into two equal parts. The incenter is equidistant from all three sides of the triangle and is the center of the inscribed circle (incircle) that touches all three sides.

    **Concept Tested:** Incenter Definition

    **See:** [Chapter 8: The Incenter](index.md#the-incenter-the-circle-within)

#### 3. Which of the four triangle centers is ALWAYS located inside the triangle, regardless of triangle type?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Circumcenter only
2. Orthocenter only
3. Centroid and incenter
4. All four centers
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **C**. The centroid and incenter are always located inside the triangle, no matter what type of triangle it is (acute, right, or obtuse). The circumcenter can be inside (acute), on the triangle (right), or outside (obtuse). The orthocenter can also be inside (acute), at a vertex (right), or outside (obtuse).

    **Concept Tested:** Triangle Center Locations

    **See:** [Chapter 8: Triangle Centers Properties](index.md)

#### 4. For an acute triangle, the circumcenter is located:

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Inside the triangle
2. On the hypotenuse
3. Outside the triangle
4. At a vertex
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **A**. For an acute triangle (all angles less than 90°), the circumcenter is located inside the triangle. For a right triangle, the circumcenter is on the hypotenuse at its midpoint. For an obtuse triangle (one angle greater than 90°), the circumcenter is located outside the triangle. The circumcenter's location tells you about the triangle's angle measures.

    **See:** [Chapter 8: Circumcenter Properties](index.md#properties-of-the-circumcenter)

#### 5. What is the Euler line?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. The line connecting all four triangle centers
2. The line on which the centroid, circumcenter, and orthocenter lie
3. The line connecting the three vertices of a triangle
4. The longest median in a triangle
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. The Euler line is the straight line on which three of the four triangle centers lie: the centroid (G), circumcenter (O), and orthocenter (H). These three points are always collinear (on the same line), with a special relationship: the distance from G to H is exactly twice the distance from O to G. The incenter is generally not on the Euler line (except in equilateral triangles where all four centers coincide).

#### 6. What is the main difference between the circumcircle and the incircle of a triangle?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. The circumcircle passes through the vertices; the incircle touches the sides
2. The circumcircle is always smaller than the incircle
3. The circumcircle is inside the triangle; the incircle is outside
4. They are the same circle
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **A**. The circumcircle is the circle that passes through all three vertices of the triangle, with center at the circumcenter. The incircle is the circle that fits inside the triangle and touches (is tangent to) all three sides, with center at the incenter. The circumcircle is always larger than the incircle. The circumcircle can extend outside the triangle, while the incircle is entirely inside.

    **See:** [Chapter 8: Circumcenter and Incenter](index.md)

#### 7. A triangle has vertices at A(0, 0), B(6, 0), and C(3, 9). What are the coordinates of the centroid?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. (3, 0)
2. (3, 3)
3. (4, 4)
4. (9, 9)
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. The centroid is found by averaging the coordinates of the three vertices: G = ((x₁+x₂+x₃)/3, (y₁+y₂+y₃)/3) = ((0+6+3)/3, (0+0+9)/3) = (9/3, 9/3) = (3, 3). The centroid is literally the "average position" of the three vertices. Option A averages only the x-coordinates. Options C and D result from calculation errors.

    **Concept Tested:** Centroid Coordinate Formula

    **See:** [Chapter 8: Centroid Formula](index.md#formula-distance-to-centroid)

#### 8. In a right triangle, where is the orthocenter located?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. At the midpoint of the hypotenuse
2. At the center of the triangle
3. At the vertex with the right angle
4. Outside the triangle
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **C**. In a right triangle, the orthocenter is located exactly at the vertex where the right angle (90° angle) is formed. This is because two of the three altitudes are the legs of the right triangle themselves, and they intersect at the right angle vertex. For acute triangles, the orthocenter is inside. For obtuse triangles, the orthocenter is outside.

    **See:** [Chapter 8: Orthocenter Properties](index.md#properties-of-the-orthocenter)

#### 9. The centroid divides each median in what ratio (from vertex to opposite side)?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. 1:1 (equal parts)
2. 2:1 (vertex to centroid is twice as long as centroid to midpoint)
3. 3:1 (vertex to centroid is three times as long)
4. 1:2 (centroid to midpoint is twice as long as vertex to centroid)
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. The centroid divides each median in a 2:1 ratio, with the longer segment being from the vertex to the centroid, and the shorter segment from the centroid to the midpoint of the opposite side. If the distance from vertex A to centroid G is d, then the distance from G to the midpoint is d/2. This 2:1 property holds for all three medians.

    **Concept Tested:** Centroid 2:1 Ratio Property

    **See:** [Chapter 8: Centroid Properties](index.md#properties-of-the-centroid)

#### 10. Why do all four triangle centers (centroid, circumcenter, orthocenter, and incenter) coincide at the same point in an equilateral triangle?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Because equilateral triangles are the only triangles with three equal sides
2. Because of the perfect symmetry—medians, altitudes, angle bisectors, and perpendicular bisectors all coincide
3. Because equilateral triangles have no angles
4. This statement is false; the centers are different points even in equilateral triangles
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. In an equilateral triangle, the perfect three-fold symmetry causes all the special segments to coincide: each median is also an altitude, an angle bisector, and a perpendicular bisector of the opposite side. Since all these segments coincide, their intersection points (the four centers) must also be the same point. This is the only triangle type where all four centers are at the same location. Option A states a fact but doesn't explain why centers coincide. Option C is false. Option D is incorrect—the statement is true.
