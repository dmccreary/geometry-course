# Chapter 12: Transformations

Investigate geometric transformations, including translations, reflections, rotations, and dilations. Understand how transformations affect figures on the coordinate plane.

**MicroSims:**

-  **Transformation Playground**: Apply different transformations to shapes and observe outcomes.
-  **Coordinate Mapping Tool**: See how points move under various transformations.
