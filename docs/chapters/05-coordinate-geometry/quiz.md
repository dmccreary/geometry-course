#### 1. A point with coordinates (-3, 5) is located in which quadrant?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Quadrant I
2. Quadrant II
3. Quadrant III
4. Quadrant IV
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. In Quadrant II, the x-coordinate is negative and the y-coordinate is positive. The point (-3, 5) has x = -3 (negative) and y = 5 (positive), placing it in Quadrant II. Quadrant I (A) has both coordinates positive. Quadrant III (C) has both negative. Quadrant IV (D) has positive x and negative y.

#### 2. What is the slope-intercept form of a linear equation?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. y - y₁ = m(x - x₁)
2. y = mx + b
3. Ax + By = C
4. x = a constant value
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. The slope-intercept form is y = mx + b, where m is the slope and b is the y-intercept. This form immediately shows both the slope and where the line crosses the y-axis. Option A is point-slope form. Option C is standard form. Option D represents a vertical line.

    **Concept Tested:** Slope-Intercept Form

    **See:** [Chapter 5: Slope-Intercept Form](index.md#slope-intercept-form)

#### 3. Two lines are parallel if and only if they have:

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Equal y-intercepts
2. Equal slopes
3. Negative reciprocal slopes
4. Different slopes
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. Parallel lines have equal slopes but different y-intercepts. Lines with the same slope maintain a constant distance apart and never intersect. Option A is incorrect—parallel lines can have different y-intercepts (and usually do). Option C describes perpendicular lines. Option D describes non-parallel lines.

    **Concept Tested:** Parallel Lines

    **See:** [Chapter 5: Parallel Lines](index.md#parallel-lines)

#### 4. A line with slope m = -3 will:

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Rise steeply from left to right
2. Be horizontal
3. Fall steeply from left to right
4. Be vertical
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **C**. A negative slope means the line falls (goes downward) from left to right. The magnitude of 3 means it's fairly steep—for every 1 unit right, the line drops 3 units down. Option A describes a positive slope. Option B describes zero slope (m = 0). Option D describes undefined slope (vertical line).

    **Concept Tested:** Slope Interpretation

    **See:** [Chapter 5: Slope](index.md#slope-measuring-steepness)

#### 5. In the equation y = 4x - 7, what does the -7 represent?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. The slope of the line
2. The x-coordinate where the line crosses the x-axis
3. The y-coordinate where the line crosses the y-axis
4. The steepness of the line
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **C**. In slope-intercept form y = mx + b, the value b represents the y-intercept—the y-coordinate where the line crosses the y-axis (at point (0, -7)). Option A is incorrect—the slope is 4. Option B confuses y-intercept with x-intercept. Option D describes the slope, not the y-intercept.

    **Concept Tested:** Y-Intercept

    **See:** [Chapter 5: Slope-Intercept Form](index.md#slope-intercept-form)

#### 6. If a line has slope m = 2/5, what is the slope of a line perpendicular to it?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. 2/5
2. 5/2
3. -5/2
4. -2/5
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **C**. Perpendicular lines have slopes that are negative reciprocals. To find the negative reciprocal of 2/5, flip the fraction (getting 5/2) and change the sign (getting -5/2). Verify: (2/5) × (-5/2) = -10/10 = -1 ✓. Option A is the same slope (parallel lines). Option B is the reciprocal but not negative. Option D is the negative but not the reciprocal.

#### 7. What is the distance between points A(1, 2) and B(4, 6)?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. 3 units
2. 4 units
3. 5 units
4. 7 units
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **C**. Using the distance formula: d = √[(x₂-x₁)² + (y₂-y₁)²] = √[(4-1)² + (6-2)²] = √[3² + 4²] = √[9 + 16] = √25 = 5 units. This forms a 3-4-5 right triangle. Option A is only the horizontal distance. Option B is only the vertical distance. Option D would result from adding distances instead of using the Pythagorean relationship.

    **Concept Tested:** Distance Formula

    **See:** [Chapter 5: Distance Formula](index.md#distance-formula)

#### 8. Find the midpoint of the segment with endpoints C(-2, 5) and D(6, -1).

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. (2, 2)
2. (4, 4)
3. (2, 3)
4. (8, 4)
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **A**. Using the midpoint formula: M = ((x₁+x₂)/2, (y₁+y₂)/2) = ((-2+6)/2, (5+(-1))/2) = (4/2, 4/2) = (2, 2). The midpoint is the average of the x-coordinates and the average of the y-coordinates. Options B, C, and D result from calculation errors in averaging.

    **Concept Tested:** Midpoint Formula

    **See:** [Chapter 5: Midpoint Formula](index.md#midpoint-formula)

#### 9. What is the slope of the line passing through points E(-3, 7) and F(2, -3)?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. -2
2. -1/2
3. 2
4. 1/2
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **A**. Using the slope formula: m = (y₂-y₁)/(x₂-x₁) = (-3-7)/(2-(-3)) = (-10)/(5) = -2. The line falls 10 units while moving 5 units to the right, giving a negative slope of -2 (fairly steep downward). Options B and D have incorrect magnitude. Option C has the wrong sign.

    **Concept Tested:** Slope Calculation

    **See:** [Chapter 5: Slope](index.md#slope-measuring-steepness)

#### 10. Line 1 has equation y = 3x + 2, and Line 2 has equation y = -⅓x - 4. What is the relationship between these lines?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. They are parallel
2. They are perpendicular
3. They are the same line
4. They are neither parallel nor perpendicular
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. Line 1 has slope m₁ = 3, and Line 2 has slope m₂ = -⅓. These slopes are negative reciprocals: 3 × (-⅓) = -1, which means the lines are perpendicular (they intersect at a 90° angle). Option A is wrong because parallel lines must have equal slopes. Option C is wrong because they have different slopes and y-intercepts. Option D is incorrect because they satisfy the perpendicular condition.
