# Coordinate Geometry and Lines

## Summary

This chapter bridges algebra and geometry by exploring lines in the coordinate plane, including slopes, equations, and distance formulas. You'll learn how to use algebraic tools to solve geometric problems and verify geometric properties analytically. By connecting coordinate methods with synthetic geometry, you'll develop powerful techniques for analyzing relationships between points, lines, and other figures.

## Concepts Covered

This chapter covers the following 8 concepts from the learning graph:

1. Distance Formula
2. Midpoint Formula
3. Transversal
4. Slope
5. Slope-Intercept Form
6. Point-Slope Form
7. Equations of Parallel Lines
8. Equations of Perpendicular Lines

## Prerequisites

This chapter builds on concepts from:

- [Chapter 1: Foundations of Geometry](../01-foundations-of-geometry/index.md)
- [Chapter 3: Angles and Angle Relationships](../03-angles-and-relationships/index.md)
