#### 1. What is the formula for the area of a triangle?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. A = bh
2. A = (1/2)bh
3. A = b² + h²
4. A = (1/3)bh
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. The area of a triangle is (1/2)bh, where b is the base and h is the height (perpendicular distance from base to opposite vertex). A triangle is half of a parallelogram with the same base and height, which explains the 1/2 factor. Option A is the formula for a parallelogram. Option C resembles the Pythagorean theorem (not an area formula). Option D is used for pyramid volume, not triangle area.

    **Concept Tested:** Area of Triangle

    **See:** [Chapter 12: Area of Triangles](index.md#area-of-triangles)

#### 2. The formula for the circumference of a circle is:

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. C = πr²
2. C = 2πr
3. C = πd²
4. C = 4πr
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. The circumference (perimeter) of a circle is C = 2πr, where r is the radius. Since the diameter d = 2r, this can also be written as C = πd. The circumference measures the distance around the circle. Option A (πr²) is the area formula for a circle, not circumference. Options C and D are incorrect formulas.

    **Concept Tested:** Circumference of Circle

    **See:** [Chapter 12: Circles](index.md#part-2-circles)

#### 3. What is the difference between a polyhedron and a non-polyhedron solid?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Polyhedra have curved surfaces; non-polyhedra have flat faces
2. Polyhedra have flat polygonal faces; non-polyhedra have curved surfaces
3. Polyhedra are always larger than non-polyhedra
4. There is no difference
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. A polyhedron is a three-dimensional solid made entirely of flat polygonal faces (like cubes, prisms, and pyramids). Non-polyhedron solids have at least one curved surface (like cylinders, cones, and spheres). Option A reverses the definitions. Option C is incorrect—size doesn't determine the classification. Option D is false—there is a clear distinction.

    **Concept Tested:** Polyhedron vs Non-Polyhedron

    **See:** [Chapter 12: Three-Dimensional Solids](index.md#part-3-three-dimensional-solids)

#### 4. A rectangle has length 8 cm and width 5 cm. What is its area?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. 13 cm²
2. 26 cm²
3. 40 cm²
4. 80 cm²
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **C**. The area of a rectangle is A = length × width = 8 × 5 = 40 cm². Area is measured in square units (cm², m², etc.). Option A (13) is the perimeter divided by 2. Option B (26) is the perimeter. Option D (80) incorrectly doubles the area or may result from a calculation error.

    **Concept Tested:** Area of Rectangle Application

    **See:** [Chapter 12: Area of Polygons](index.md#understanding-area)

#### 5. Which two formulas correctly express the volume of a cylinder with radius r and height h?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. V = πr²h
2. V = (1/3)πr²h
3. V = 2πrh
4. V = πrh²
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **A**. The volume of a cylinder is V = πr²h, which equals (base area) × height. The base is a circle with area πr², and when multiplied by height h, we get the volume. Option B ((1/3)πr²h) is the formula for a cone's volume, which is one-third the volume of a cylinder with the same base and height. Option C (2πrh) is the lateral surface area of a cylinder. Option D has the wrong exponents.

    **Concept Tested:** Volume of Cylinder

    **See:** [Chapter 12: Volume Formulas](index.md)

#### 6. A trapezoid has bases of 10 cm and 14 cm, and a height of 6 cm. What is its area?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. 60 cm²
2. 72 cm²
3. 84 cm²
4. 144 cm²
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. The area of a trapezoid is A = (1/2)(b₁ + b₂)h = (1/2)(10 + 14)(6) = (1/2)(24)(6) = 72 cm². You average the two bases and multiply by the height. Option A uses only one base. Option C adds all three measurements. Option D is the product of all three measurements.

    **Concept Tested:** Area of Trapezoid Application

    **See:** [Chapter 12: Area of Polygons](index.md#part-1-area-of-polygons)

#### 7. Compare the volumes of a cylinder and a cone that have the same radius and height. How do they relate?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. The cone's volume is equal to the cylinder's volume
2. The cone's volume is half the cylinder's volume
3. The cone's volume is one-third the cylinder's volume
4. The cone's volume is twice the cylinder's volume
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **C**. A cone with the same base radius and height as a cylinder has exactly one-third the volume: V_cone = (1/3)πr²h compared to V_cylinder = πr²h. This 1:3 relationship also holds for pyramids and prisms with the same base and height. You could fit exactly three cones' worth of water into a cylinder with matching dimensions.

#### 8. A circle has a radius of 7 cm. What is its area? (Use π ≈ 3.14)

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. 22 cm²
2. 44 cm²
3. 154 cm²
4. 616 cm²
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **C**. Using the circle area formula A = πr² = π(7)² = 49π ≈ 49 × 3.14 = 153.86 ≈ 154 cm². The area is proportional to the radius squared, so doubling the radius quadruples the area. Option A uses the radius alone. Option B uses the diameter. Option D squares the area or makes a calculation error.

    **Concept Tested:** Area of Circle Application

    **See:** [Chapter 12: Area of Circle](index.md#part-2-circles)

#### 9. A cube has a side length of 4 cm. What is its total surface area?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. 16 cm²
2. 24 cm²
3. 64 cm²
4. 96 cm²
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **D**. A cube has 6 congruent square faces. Each face has area = s² = 4² = 16 cm². Total surface area = 6 × 16 = 96 cm². The formula can also be written as SA = 6s² = 6(4)² = 96 cm². Option A is the area of one face. Option B might result from counting only some faces. Option C is the volume (4³), not surface area.

    **Concept Tested:** Surface Area of Cube

    **See:** [Chapter 12: Surface Area](index.md#part-4-surface-area)

#### 10. A sphere has a radius of 3 cm. What is its volume? (Use π ≈ 3.14 and the formula V = (4/3)πr³)

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. 36π cm³ ≈ 113 cm³
2. 27π cm³ ≈ 85 cm³
3. 12π cm³ ≈ 38 cm³
4. 9π cm³ ≈ 28 cm³
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **A**. Using the sphere volume formula: V = (4/3)πr³ = (4/3)π(3)³ = (4/3)π(27) = (4 × 27)/3 × π = 108/3 × π = 36π ≈ 113 cm³. The sphere's volume depends on the cube of the radius, so doubling the radius multiplies the volume by 8. Option B uses only r³ without the (4/3) factor. Option C and D result from calculation errors with the exponent or fraction.

    **Concept Tested:** Volume of Sphere Application

    **See:** [Chapter 12: Volume Formulas](index.md)
