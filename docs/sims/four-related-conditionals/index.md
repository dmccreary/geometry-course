## Description

This diagram displays the four related conditional statements that arise from any conditional statement "If p, then q":

- **Original Conditional** (p → q): The given statement
- **Converse** (q → p): Switch the hypothesis and conclusion
- **Inverse** (~p → ~q): Negate both the hypothesis and conclusion
- **Contrapositive** (~q → ~p): Switch AND negate the hypothesis and conclusion

The diagram uses a concrete geometry example ("If it's a square, then it has 4 right angles") to illustrate each form and shows which are true and which are false.

Key logical relationships shown with arrows:

- The **Original** and its **Contrapositive** are always logically equivalent (both true or both false)
- The **Converse** and the **Inverse** are always logically equivalent to each other
- Dashed arrows show how each form is derived from the original

## Lesson Plan

### Learning Objective

Students will be able to construct the converse, inverse, and contrapositive of a conditional statement and understand their logical relationships (Bloom's Taxonomy: Analyzing).

### Warm-Up (5 minutes)

Ask students: "If it is raining, then the ground is wet." Is this true? What about: "If the ground is wet, then it is raining." Is that always true? Why or why not?

### Direct Instruction (10 minutes)

1. Display the diagram and walk through each quadrant
2. Emphasize the pattern: how each form relates to the original
3. Highlight the logical equivalence relationships (green and gray arrows)
4. Discuss why the original and contrapositive always share the same truth value

### Guided Practice (10 minutes)

Give students a new conditional: "If a shape is a triangle, then it has exactly 3 sides."
Have them construct:

- The converse
- The inverse
- The contrapositive
- Determine which are true and which are false

### Independent Practice (10 minutes)

Students create their own conditional statements from geometry vocabulary and construct all four related forms, determining truth values for each.

### Assessment

- Can students correctly form all four related statements?
- Can students identify which pairs are logically equivalent?
- Can students determine truth values using counterexamples?
