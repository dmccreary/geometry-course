## About This MicroSim

This visual summary chart displays all four angle relationships formed when a transversal crosses parallel lines. Hover over each panel to see it highlighted with detailed information about that relationship type.

## The Four Relationships

| Relationship | Property | Example |
|--------------|----------|---------|
| **Corresponding Angles** | Congruent (≅) | ∠1 = ∠5 |
| **Alternate Interior Angles** | Congruent (≅) | ∠3 = ∠6 |
| **Alternate Exterior Angles** | Congruent (≅) | ∠1 = ∠8 |
| **Same-Side Interior Angles** | Supplementary (+) | ∠3 + ∠5 = 180° |

## How to Use

1. **Hover over each panel** to highlight that relationship
2. **Observe the mini diagrams** showing which angles form each pair
3. **Compare the properties** - three are congruent, one is supplementary
4. **Note the patterns** - position determines the relationship type

## Key Insights

- **Three Congruent Pairs**: Corresponding, Alternate Interior, and Alternate Exterior angles are all equal
- **One Supplementary Pair**: Same-Side Interior angles add to 180°
- **Position Matters**: The location of angles relative to the transversal and parallel lines determines their relationship

## Learning Objectives

- **Recognize** all four angle relationship types at a glance
- **Compare** the properties of different angle pairs
- **Understand** the pattern: most pairs are congruent, same-side interior is supplementary

## Bloom's Taxonomy Level

**Analyzing** and **Evaluating** - Comparing and categorizing angle relationships.
