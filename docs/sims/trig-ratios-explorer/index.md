## About This MicroSim

This interactive visualization demonstrates the three basic trigonometric ratios in a right triangle:

- **Sine (sin)** - Red: Opposite / Hypotenuse
- **Cosine (cos)** - Blue: Adjacent / Hypotenuse
- **Tangent (tan)** - Purple: Opposite / Adjacent

Use the slider to change the angle θ and watch how all the ratios update in real-time.

## SOH-CAH-TOA

The memory aid **SOH-CAH-TOA** helps you remember which sides to use:

| Ratio | Mnemonic | Formula |
|-------|----------|---------|
| Sine | **SOH** | **S**in = **O**pposite / **H**ypotenuse |
| Cosine | **CAH** | **C**os = **A**djacent / **H**ypotenuse |
| Tangent | **TOA** | **T**an = **O**pposite / **A**djacent |

## Key Observations

As you change the angle θ:

- **sin(θ)** increases from near 0 to near 1 as θ goes from 0° to 90°
- **cos(θ)** decreases from near 1 to near 0 as θ goes from 0° to 90°
- **tan(θ)** increases without bound as θ approaches 90°

## Special Angles

Try these common angles:

| Angle | sin | cos | tan |
|-------|-----|-----|-----|
| 30° | 0.5 | 0.866 | 0.577 |
| 45° | 0.707 | 0.707 | 1.0 |
| 60° | 0.866 | 0.5 | 1.732 |

## Learning Objectives

- Identify opposite, adjacent, and hypotenuse relative to an angle
- Calculate sine, cosine, and tangent ratios
- Understand how trig ratios change as angles change
