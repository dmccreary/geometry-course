## About This Diagram

This reference diagram shows all five steps of copying a segment construction in a single view. Hover over each panel to highlight and examine the steps.

## The Five Steps

| Panel | Step | Action |
|-------|------|--------|
| **1** | Given | Segment AB and point C |
| **2** | Step 1 | Draw ray from C |
| **3** | Step 2 | Set compass radius to AB |
| **4** | Step 3 | Draw arc from C |
| **5** | Result | CD ≅ AB (congruent segments) |

## How to Use

1. **Hover over each panel** to highlight and examine the construction
2. **Follow left to right** to see the progression
3. **Notice the color coding** - each step has a distinct color

## Learning Objectives

- **Follow** the sequential steps of segment copying
- **Identify** the role of each step in the construction
- **Understand** why the construction creates congruent segments

## Bloom's Taxonomy Level

**Understanding** and **Applying** - Reference for construction methods.
