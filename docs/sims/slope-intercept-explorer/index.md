## About This MicroSim

This interactive tool lets you explore the slope-intercept form y = mx + b by adjusting sliders for slope (m) and y-intercept (b). Watch the line change in real-time as you modify the equation parameters.

## How to Use

1. **Adjust Slope (m)**: Move the left slider to change the steepness and direction
2. **Adjust Y-intercept (b)**: Move the right slider to shift the line up or down
3. **Observe Changes**: Watch how the line and equation update instantly

## Controls

| Slider | Range | What It Controls |
|--------|-------|------------------|
| **Slope (m)** | -3 to 3 | Steepness and direction of the line |
| **Y-intercept (b)** | -5 to 5 | Where the line crosses the y-axis |

## Line Colors

| Color | Slope Type |
|-------|------------|
| **Red** | Positive slope (rises left to right) |
| **Purple** | Negative slope (falls left to right) |
| **Green** | Zero slope (horizontal line) |

## Learning Objectives

- **Apply** slope-intercept form to graph lines
- **Analyze** how changing m and b affects the line
- **Evaluate** the relationship between equation parameters and graph

## Bloom's Taxonomy Level

**Applying**, **Analyzing**, and **Evaluating** - Interactive exploration.
