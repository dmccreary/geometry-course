## About This MicroSim

This comprehensive practice workbench provides exercises for all eight construction techniques covered in Chapter 4. Select a problem, step through the solution, and master geometric constructions.

## Available Problems

| Level | Problem | Description |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| **1** | Copy Segment | Transfer a segment length |
| **1** | Bisect Segment | Find the midpoint |
| **1** | Bisect Angle | Divide an angle in half |
| **2** | Perpendicular (On Line) | Perpendicular at a point |
| **2** | Perpendicular (To Line) | Perpendicular from a point |
| **2** | Parallel Line | Line through point parallel to given line |
| **3** | Equilateral Triangle | Triangle with equal sides |
| **3** | Square | Square with given side |

## How to Use

1. **Select a problem** from the bottom row
2. **Step through** using Next/Prev buttons
3. **Show Solution** to see the complete construction
4. **Practice** until you can do it without hints

## Difficulty Levels

- **Level 1** (Green): Basic constructions
- **Level 2** (Orange): Intermediate constructions
- **Level 3** (Red): Advanced constructions

## Learning Objectives

- **Practice** all construction techniques with feedback
- **Analyze** each step of the construction process
- **Evaluate** your understanding through progressive difficulty

## Bloom's Taxonomy Level

**Applying**, **Analyzing**, and **Evaluating** - Comprehensive practice.
