## About This Diagram

This two-panel diagram shows how slope (m) and y-intercept (b) determine a line in slope-intercept form. The left panel shows a positive slope example, while the right panel demonstrates a negative slope.

## Examples Shown

| Panel | Equation | Slope (m) | Y-intercept (b) | Direction |
|-------|----------|-----------|-----------------|-----------|
| **Left** | y = 2x + 1 | 2 | 1 | Rises left to right |
| **Right** | y = -x + 4 | -1 | 4 | Falls left to right |

## Key Concepts

- **Slope (m)**: Determines the steepness and direction of the line
- **Y-intercept (b)**: Where the line crosses the y-axis at point (0, b)
- **Rise over Run**: The slope triangle shows how to move from one point to another

## How to Use

1. Start at the y-intercept (green highlighted point)
2. Use the slope to find additional points: move "run" right and "rise" up/down
3. Connect the points to graph the line

## Learning Objectives

- **Understand** the meaning of m and b in y = mx + b
- **Apply** slope-intercept form to graph lines

## Bloom's Taxonomy Level

**Understanding** and **Applying** - Equation interpretation and graphing.
