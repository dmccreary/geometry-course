## About This MicroSim

The Reasoning Detective is an interactive game that challenges students to practice three types of mathematical reasoning fundamental to geometry:

1. **Inductive Reasoning** -- Observe patterns in examples and make generalizations
2. **Deductive Reasoning** -- Apply given facts and logical rules to reach conclusions
3. **Counterexample Hunting** -- Find specific numbers that disprove false conjectures

Each problem type has a distinct interaction style: multiple-choice for inductive and deductive challenges, and a number pad with a "Test It!" button for counterexample problems.

## How to Play

1. Read the problem displayed in the top section
2. For **Inductive** and **Deductive** problems, click on the answer option you believe is correct
3. For **Counterexample** problems, use the number pad (or keyboard) to enter a number, then click "Test It!"
4. Use the **Hint** button if you need help
5. Use **Explain Answer** to see the full reasoning after answering
6. Click **New Problem** to get a random new challenge

## Problem Types

| Type | Badge Color | Description |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| Inductive | Blue | Pattern recognition from examples |
| Deductive | Green | Logical conclusions from given facts |
| Counterexample | Orange | Find numbers that disprove conjectures |

## Lesson Plan

### Grade Level
9-12 (High School Geometry)

### Duration
20-30 minutes

### Learning Objectives

After using this MicroSim, students will be able to:

- **Evaluate** mathematical statements by applying inductive and deductive reasoning
- **Create** counterexamples to disprove false conjectures
- **Distinguish** between inductive reasoning (pattern-based) and deductive reasoning (logic-based)
- **Recognize** that a single counterexample is sufficient to disprove a conjecture

### Bloom's Taxonomy Levels

- **Evaluating** -- Judging whether statements and conjectures are true or false
- **Creating** -- Constructing counterexamples to disprove conjectures

### Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of geometric terms (angles, polygons, lines)
- Familiarity with number properties (even, odd, prime, divisibility)

### Activities

1. **Introduction** (5 min): Discuss the differences between inductive and deductive reasoning with real-world examples
2. **Guided Practice** (10 min): Work through 2-3 problems as a class, discussing the reasoning process for each type
3. **Independent Practice** (10 min): Students work through problems individually, aiming for a high accuracy score
4. **Discussion** (5 min): Share challenging problems and discuss strategies used to find counterexamples

### Assessment

- Can students correctly identify patterns using inductive reasoning?
- Can students apply given facts to draw valid deductive conclusions?
- Can students find counterexamples to disprove false conjectures?
- Can students articulate the difference between inductive and deductive reasoning?
