## About This MicroSim

The Reasoning Detective is an interactive game that challenges students to practice three types of mathematical reasoning:

1. **Inductive Reasoning** - Observe patterns and make generalizations
2. **Deductive Reasoning** - Apply logical rules to reach conclusions
3. **Counterexample Hunting** - Find examples that disprove false conjectures

## How to Play

1. Read the problem and the given information carefully
2. Click on the answer you think is correct
3. Click "Check Answer" to see if you're right
4. Use "Hint" if you need help
5. Click "New Problem" to advance to the next challenge

## Problem Types

| Type | Color | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| Inductive | Green | Pattern recognition from examples |
| Deductive | Blue | Logical conclusions from given facts |
| Counterexample | Orange | Find examples that disprove statements |

## Learning Objectives

After playing this game, students will be able to:

- **Recognize** patterns using inductive reasoning
- **Apply** deductive reasoning to reach valid conclusions
- **Evaluate** conjectures by finding counterexamples
- **Distinguish** between inductive and deductive reasoning

## Bloom's Taxonomy Levels

- **Evaluating** - Judging whether statements are true or false
- **Creating** - Constructing counterexamples to disprove conjectures

## Lesson Plan

### Grade Level
9-12 (High School Geometry)

### Duration
20-30 minutes

### Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of geometric terms
- Familiarity with logical statements

### Activities

1. **Introduction** (5 min): Discuss the differences between inductive and deductive reasoning.

2. **Guided Practice** (10 min): Work through 2-3 problems as a class, discussing the reasoning process.

3. **Independent Practice** (10 min): Students work through problems individually, aiming for a high score.

4. **Discussion** (5 min): Share challenging problems and discuss strategies.

### Assessment
- Can students identify the type of reasoning being used?
- Can students find counterexamples to disprove false conjectures?
- Can students apply deductive reasoning correctly?
