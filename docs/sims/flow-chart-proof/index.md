## About This MicroSim

This interactive visualization demonstrates how the **Vertical Angles Theorem** can be proved using a flow chart format. The proof unfolds step-by-step, showing how each statement logically leads to the next.

## How to Use

1. **Next/Prev buttons** - Step through the proof one statement at a time
2. **Auto Play** - Watch the entire proof unfold automatically
3. **Speed slider** - Adjust how fast auto-play advances (1-5 seconds)
4. **Reset** - Return to the beginning

## The Flow Chart Structure

The proof branches and merges:

- **Green boxes** - Given and final conclusion
- **Blue boxes** - Linear pair definitions
- **Orange boxes** - Supplementary angle relationships
- **Purple boxes** - Algebraic manipulation steps

## Proof Logic

1. Start with vertical angles (Given)
2. Both angles form linear pairs with a third angle
3. Linear pairs are supplementary (180°)
4. Use algebra to show the angles are equal
5. Conclude angles are congruent

## Interactive Features

- **Step-by-step reveal** - See how each step builds on previous ones
- **Glowing effect** - Current step is highlighted
- **Auto-play mode** - Automated progression through all steps
- **Adjustable speed** - Control the pace of learning

## Learning Objectives

- **Interpret** flow chart proofs with branching logic
- **Trace** logical dependencies between statements
- **Understand** how parallel reasoning paths can converge

## Bloom's Taxonomy Level

**Analyzing** - Understanding the logical structure and dependencies in proofs.
