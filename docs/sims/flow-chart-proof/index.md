## About This MicroSim

This interactive visualization demonstrates how the **Vertical Angles Theorem** can be proved using a flow chart format. The proof unfolds step-by-step, showing how each statement logically leads to the next through boxes connected by arrows.

## How to Use

1. **Next/Prev buttons** - Step through the proof one statement at a time
2. **Auto Play** - Watch the entire proof unfold automatically
3. **Speed slider** - Drag to adjust how fast auto-play advances
4. **Reset** - Return to the beginning

## The Flow Chart Structure

The proof branches from a single given into two parallel paths that converge:

- **Green boxes** - Given information and final conclusion
- **Blue boxes** - Linear pair definitions
- **Orange boxes** - Supplementary angle relationships
- **Purple boxes** - Algebraic manipulation steps leading to proof

## Proof Logic

1. Start with vertical angles (Given)
2. Both angles form linear pairs with a third angle
3. Linear pairs are supplementary (sum to 180 degrees)
4. Use the Transitive Property since both sums equal 180 degrees
5. Apply the Subtraction Property to eliminate the common angle
6. Conclude the angles are congruent

## Learning Objectives

- **Interpret** flow chart proofs with branching logic
- **Trace** logical dependencies between statements
- **Understand** how parallel reasoning paths can converge

## Bloom's Taxonomy Level

**Analyzing** - Students interpret and trace logical structure and dependencies in flow chart proofs.
