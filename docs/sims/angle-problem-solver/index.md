## About This MicroSim

This interactive practice tool generates random angle relationship problems and provides step-by-step hints to help you solve them. Track your score as you practice!

## Problem Types

| Type | Relationship | Property |
|------|--------------|----------|
| **Complementary** | Two angles sum to 90° | a + b = 90° |
| **Supplementary** | Two angles sum to 180° | a + b = 180° |
| **Vertical** | Opposite angles at intersection | Equal (≅) |
| **Linear Pair** | Adjacent angles on a line | Sum to 180° |
| **Angle Bisector** | Ray divides angle in half | Half of original |
| **Corresponding** | Same position at parallel lines | Equal (≅) |
| **Alternate Interior** | Opposite sides, between lines | Equal (≅) |
| **Same-Side Interior** | Same side, between lines | Sum to 180° |

## How to Use

1. **Read the problem** displayed at the top
2. **Study the diagram** showing the given and unknown angles
3. **Enter your answer** in degrees
4. **Click Check** to see if you're correct
5. **Use Hints** if you need help (3 available per problem)
6. **Click Solution** to see the complete answer
7. **Click Next Problem** for a new challenge
