## About This MicroSim

This interactive visualization guides students through the four stages of **indirect proof** (proof by contradiction). Choose from multiple geometry examples and step through each stage to understand how assuming the opposite leads to a contradiction.

## The Four Stages

1. **ASSUME OPPOSITE** - Negate what you want to prove
2. **DERIVE CONSEQUENCES** - Follow the logical implications
3. **FIND CONTRADICTION** - Discover the clash with known truths
4. **CONCLUDE TRUTH** - The original statement must be true

## How to Use

1. **Select a proof** from the dropdown menu
2. **Click Next Stage** to reveal each part of the proof
3. **Observe** how each stage builds on the previous one
4. **Notice** the contradiction that emerges in stage 3
5. Use **Reset** to start over with a new proof

## Available Proofs

- **Lines intersect at one point** - Classic intersection uniqueness
- **Isosceles triangle base angles** - Equal sides mean equal angles
- **Parallel lines alternate angles** - Transversal angle relationships

## Interactive Features

- **Stage-by-stage reveal** - See the proof unfold logically
- **Multiple examples** - Compare different indirect proofs
- **Visual highlighting** - Current stage glows for emphasis
- **Color-coded stages** - Each stage has a distinct color

## Why Indirect Proof?

Some statements are easier to prove by contradiction:

1. Assume the opposite is true
2. Show this leads to an impossibility
3. Conclude the original statement must be true

## Learning Objectives

- **Construct** indirect proofs by identifying assumptions
- **Derive** consequences from assumed statements
- **Identify** contradictions with known postulates/theorems
- **Evaluate** when indirect proof is appropriate

## Bloom's Taxonomy Level

**Evaluating** - Constructing indirect proofs requires evaluating logical consequences.
