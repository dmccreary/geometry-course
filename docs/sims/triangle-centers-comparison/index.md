## About This MicroSim

This interactive visualization shows all four **classical triangle centers** in a single view, allowing direct comparison of their positions and behaviors as the triangle shape changes.

## The Four Centers

| Center | Symbol | Defined By | Special Property |
|--------|--------|------------|------------------|
| **Centroid** | G | Medians | Balance point; always inside |
| **Circumcenter** | O | Perpendicular bisectors | Equidistant from vertices |
| **Orthocenter** | H | Altitudes | On Euler line |
| **Incenter** | I | Angle bisectors | Equidistant from sides; always inside |

## Key Relationships

### The Euler Line
When all centers are visible, notice the **Euler line** (dashed brown) connecting:
- G (Centroid)
- O (Circumcenter)
- H (Orthocenter)

The **incenter (I) generally does NOT lie on the Euler line** (except in isosceles triangles).

### Location Behavior
- **G and I**: Always inside the triangle
- **O**: Inside (acute), on hypotenuse (right), outside (obtuse)
- **H**: Inside (acute), at right-angle vertex (right), outside (obtuse)

## Interactions

- **Drag vertices** to reshape the triangle
- **Click buttons** to toggle individual centers on/off
- **Watch** how center positions change with triangle type

## Learning Objectives

- Compare the four classical triangle centers
- Recognize which centers lie on the Euler line
- Understand how center locations depend on triangle type

## Bloom's Taxonomy Level
