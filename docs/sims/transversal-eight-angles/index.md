## About This MicroSim

This static diagram shows the standard setup of two parallel lines (line l and line m) cut by a transversal (line t). The eight angles formed at the two intersection points are numbered 1 through 8, providing a reference for identifying the special angle pairs that arise from this configuration.

## Key Concepts

| Angle Pair | Angles | Relationship |
|---|---|---|
| Corresponding | 1 & 5, 2 & 6, 3 & 7, 4 & 8 | Congruent |
| Alternate Interior | 3 & 5, 4 & 6 | Congruent |
| Alternate Exterior | 1 & 7, 2 & 8 | Congruent |
| Same-Side Interior | 3 & 6, 4 & 5 | Supplementary (sum to 180) |

## Angle Numbering Convention

At each intersection, angles are numbered clockwise starting from the upper-left position:

- **Top intersection:** Angles 1, 2, 3, 4
- **Bottom intersection:** Angles 5, 6, 7, 8

## Learning Objectives

- **Identify** the eight angles formed when a transversal crosses two parallel lines
- **Name** the four types of special angle pairs
- **State** which pairs are congruent and which are supplementary

## Bloom's Taxonomy Level

**Remembering** and **Understanding** -- Identifying and classifying angle pairs in the parallel-lines-and-transversal setup.
