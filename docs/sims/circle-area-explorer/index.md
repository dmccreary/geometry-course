[Run the Circle Area Explorer MicroSim](circle-area-explorer.html)

### Features:

1.  **Interactive Radius Slider**:

-   Adjusts the circle radius dynamically.
-   Updates the area calculation and display.

3.  **Toggle Graph Button**:

Toggles the visibility of the graph plotting the relationship between radius and area.4.  **Graph**:

Illustrates how the area of the circle grows quadratically with increasing radius.

### Learning Outcomes:

-   Students visualize the quadratic relationship $A = \pi r^2$
-   Observe that area increases faster than the radius due to the quadratic term.
