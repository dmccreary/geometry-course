## About This Diagram

This visualization shows the Base Angles Theorem for isosceles triangles through three examples: parts identification, theorem application, and the converse.

## Parts of an Isosceles Triangle

| Part | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Legs** | The two congruent sides |
| **Base** | The third side (not necessarily the bottom) |
| **Vertex angle** | The angle between the two legs |
| **Base angles** | The two angles at the ends of the base |

## Base Angles Theorem

**If two sides of a triangle are congruent, then the angles opposite those sides are congruent.**

In other words: Equal sides → Equal angles

## Converse

**If two angles of a triangle are congruent, then the sides opposite those angles are congruent.**

In other words: Equal angles → Equal sides (triangle is isosceles)

## Example Calculation

Given: AB = AC = 6 cm, ∠A = 40°

By Base Angles Theorem: ∠B = ∠C

Using Triangle Sum: 40° + 2∠B = 180°

Therefore: **∠B = ∠C = 70°**
