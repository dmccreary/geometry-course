## About This Diagram

This visualization demonstrates the Exterior Angle Theorem with two views: a detailed single example and a comparison showing all three vertices.

## Exterior Angle Theorem

**The measure of an exterior angle of a triangle equals the sum of the measures of the two remote interior angles.**

$$m\angle_{exterior} = m\angle_{remote_1} + m\angle_{remote_2}$$

## Key Terms

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Exterior angle** | An angle formed when one side of a triangle is extended |
| **Remote interior angles** | The two interior angles NOT adjacent to the exterior angle |
| **Adjacent interior angle** | The interior angle that forms a linear pair with the exterior angle |

## Example Calculation

For a triangle with angles 50°, 60°, and 70°:
- Exterior angle at C = ∠A + ∠B = 50° + 60° = **110°**
- Check: 110° + 70° = 180° (linear pair)

## Key Facts

- An exterior angle is always larger than either remote interior angle
- The exterior angle and adjacent interior angle form a linear pair (sum to 180°)

## Interaction
