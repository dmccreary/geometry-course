## About This Diagram

This diagram shows the three classifications of triangles based on their angle measures.

## Triangle Types by Angles

| Type | Definition | Properties |
|------|------------|------------|
| **Acute** | All three angles less than 90° | "Pointed" appearance |
| **Right** | Exactly one 90° angle | Right angle marked with square; hypotenuse is longest side |
| **Obtuse** | Exactly one angle greater than 90° | "Wide" appearance; other two angles must be acute |

## Visual Markers

- **Arc marks** at angles show the angle measurements
- **Right angle square** (small square symbol) indicates a 90° angle
- Larger arcs indicate obtuse angles (>90°)

## Key Facts

- Every triangle falls into exactly ONE of these classifications by angle
- A right triangle always has exactly one 90° angle
- An obtuse triangle can only have one obtuse angle (the other two must be acute)

## Interaction

Click on any triangle panel to highlight that type and dim the others.

## Learning Objectives

- **Remember** the three angle-based classifications
- **Understand** how angle measures determine triangle type

## Bloom's Taxonomy Level

**Remembering** and **Understanding** - Terminology introduction.
