## About This Diagram

This side-by-side comparison demonstrates why the **included angle** matters in triangle congruence proofs. It contrasts valid SAS with the ambiguous SSA case.

## Side-by-Side Comparison

### Left Side: Valid SAS
- Two sides and their **included** angle are congruent
- The angle is BETWEEN the two marked sides
- This guarantees triangle congruence

### Right Side: Invalid SSA
- Two sides and a **non-included** angle are marked
- The angle is NOT between the marked sides
- Two different triangles can have the same SSA measurements!

## Key Concept: Included Angle

**Included angle:** The angle formed BY the two sides being compared.

- In SAS: ∠B is between sides AB and BC
- In SSA: ∠C is NOT between sides AB and AC

## SAS Congruence Postulate

**If two sides and the included angle of one triangle are congruent to two sides and the included angle of another triangle, then the triangles are congruent.**

## Warning About SSA

SSA (Side-Side-Angle with a non-included angle) is NOT a valid congruence criterion because the same SSA measurements can produce two different triangles.
