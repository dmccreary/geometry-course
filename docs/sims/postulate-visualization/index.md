## About This MicroSim

This gallery-style diagram illustrates five fundamental geometric postulates with clear visual examples arranged in two rows (three on top, two on bottom).

**Panels:**

1. **Two Points, One Line** -- Two red points A and B with a single blue line through both, showing that exactly one line passes through any two points.
2. **Line in a Plane** -- A tilted gray-green plane with two green points P and Q, and a green line through them lying entirely within the plane.
3. **Three Points, One Plane** -- Three purple points R, S, T forming a triangle on a transparent purple plane, demonstrating that three non-collinear points define a unique plane.
4. **Two Lines, One Intersection** -- Red and blue lines crossing at a yellow-highlighted intersection point X, illustrating that two intersecting lines meet at exactly one point.
5. **Parallel Postulate** -- A horizontal blue line L with a red point P above it, a dashed red parallel line through P, and gray rejected non-parallel lines crossed out.

## How to Use

- **Hover** over any panel to highlight it
- Study each diagram to connect the visual representation to the postulate statement
- Read the annotations at the bottom of each panel for a concise summary

## Learning Objectives

- **Recognize** and **recall** the five fundamental geometric postulates
- **Connect** visual representations to formal postulate statements
- **Build** a foundation for constructing geometric proofs

## Bloom's Taxonomy Level

**Remembering** -- Recognizing and recalling fundamental geometric postulates and their visual representations.
