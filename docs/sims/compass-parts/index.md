## About This Diagram

This interactive diagram introduces the parts of a compass and demonstrates how circles are constructed. Hover over compass parts to learn about each component.

## Compass Parts

| Part | Function |
|------|----------|
| **Fixed Point** | Sharp point that stays at the center |
| **Pencil Point** | Draws the circle arc |
| **Compass Legs** | Two arms that spread apart |
| **Adjustment Hinge** | Controls the radius distance |

## Key Concept

A compass draws perfect circles because every point on the circle is exactly the same distance (the radius) from the center point.

## How to Use

1. **Hover over compass parts** to see their names and descriptions
2. **Watch the animation** showing how a circle is drawn
3. **Observe the colored radii** demonstrating that all radii are equal

## Learning Objectives

- **Identify** the parts of a compass
- **Understand** how circles are constructed
- **Recognize** that all radii of a circle are equal

## Bloom's Taxonomy Level

**Remembering** and **Understanding** - Identifying parts and understanding construction.
