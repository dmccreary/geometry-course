## About This MicroSim

The Angle Builder is an interactive tool that allows students to create and explore angles by rotating a ray around a fixed vertex. As the angle changes, students can observe:

- **Angle measurement** in degrees (0° to 360°)
- **Angle classification** (acute, right, obtuse, straight, reflex)
- **Complementary angles** (two angles that sum to 90°)
- **Supplementary angles** (two angles that sum to 180°)

## How to Use

1. **Slider**: Drag the slider to rotate Ray 2 and create different angles
2. **Reset**: Click "Reset to 0°" to return to the starting position
3. **Random**: Click "Random" to generate a random angle
4. **Snap**: Use the dropdown to snap to common angle measures (15°, 30°, 45°, 90°)

## Angle Classifications

| Angle Type | Measure | Color |
|------------|---------|-------|
| Acute | 0° < angle < 90° | Green |
| Right | angle = 90° | Purple |
| Obtuse | 90° < angle < 180° | Orange |
| Straight | angle = 180° | Red |
| Reflex | 180° < angle < 360° | Blue |

## Learning Objectives

After using this MicroSim, students will be able to:

- **Create** angles of specific measures using ray rotation
- **Classify** angles as acute, right, obtuse, straight, or reflex
- **Calculate** complementary and supplementary angles
- **Analyze** the relationship between ray positions and angle measurements

## Bloom's Taxonomy Level

**Creating and Analyzing** - Students actively construct angles and analyze the relationships between angle measures and classifications.

## Lesson Plan

### Grade Level
9-12 (High School Geometry)

### Duration
15-20 minutes

### Prerequisites
- Understanding of rays and vertices
- Basic knowledge of degree measurement

### Activities

1. **Exploration** (5 min): Have students freely explore the angle builder, creating various angles and observing the classifications.

2. **Targeted Practice** (5 min): Ask students to create specific angles:
   - A 45° acute angle
   - A 90° right angle
   - A 120° obtuse angle
   - A 180° straight angle

3. **Complementary Challenge** (3 min): For any acute angle created, have students verify that the complement shown equals 90° minus their angle.

4. **Supplementary Challenge** (3 min): For angles less than 180°, verify that the supplement shown equals 180° minus their angle.

5. **Classification Game** (4 min): One student calls out an angle type, and another must create an angle of that type using the slider.

### Assessment
- Can students create angles of specified measures?
- Can students correctly classify angles by type?
- Can students calculate complementary and supplementary angles?
