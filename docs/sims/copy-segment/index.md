## About This MicroSim

This interactive tutorial walks you through the classical compass and straightedge construction for copying a line segment. Each step is animated to show exactly how the construction works.

## Construction Steps

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| **1** | Draw a ray from point C |
| **2** | Set compass radius equal to AB |
| **3** | Place compass point on C |
| **4** | Draw arc intersecting the ray at D |
| **5** | Complete! CD ≅ AB |

## How to Use

1. **Click "Next"** to advance through each step
2. **Click "Previous"** to go back and review
3. **Click "Auto Play"** to watch the full animation
4. **Click "Reset"** to start over

## Why It Works

The compass preserves the distance from A to B. When we place the compass at C with the same radius and draw an arc, point D is exactly the same distance from C as B is from A.

## Learning Objectives

- **Perform** the steps to copy a segment
- **Understand** why the construction creates congruent segments
- **Apply** compass and straightedge techniques

## Bloom's Taxonomy Level

**Applying** and **Understanding** - Performing construction and explaining the process.
