## About This MicroSim

This interactive tool lets you build line equations using point-slope form. Drag the point P anywhere on the grid and adjust the slope slider to see both the point-slope form and slope-intercept form update in real-time.

## How to Use

1. **Drag Point P**: Click and drag the blue point anywhere on the grid
2. **Adjust Slope**: Use the slider to change the slope (m)
3. **Watch Equations**: See both equation forms update instantly
4. **Conversion Steps**: Follow the step-by-step conversion from point-slope to slope-intercept form

## Controls

| Control | Function |
|---------|----------|
| **Drag Point P** | Move the reference point on the line |
| **Slope Slider** | Adjust the slope from -3 to 3 |
| **Random** | Generate new random point and slope |
| **Triangle: ON/OFF** | Toggle the rise/run triangle display |
| **Snap: ON/OFF** | Toggle grid snapping |

## Equation Forms Shown

| Form | Example |
|------|---------|
| **Point-Slope** | y - 4 = 2(x - 3) |
| **Slope-Intercept** | y = 2x - 2 |

## Learning Objectives

- **Apply** point-slope form to write equations given a point and slope
- **Analyze** the conversion between point-slope and slope-intercept forms

## Bloom's Taxonomy Level

**Applying** and **Analyzing** - Equation building and form conversion.
