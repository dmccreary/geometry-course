## About This MicroSim

This diagram shows how to **strategically place a geometric figure** on the coordinate plane for a coordinate proof. It demonstrates the key steps for proving that the diagonals of a rectangle are congruent using the distance formula.

## What This Diagram Shows

- **Rectangle ABCD** placed with vertex A at the origin
- **Sides aligned with axes** for simpler algebra
- **Variable coordinates** (a, b) to prove for all rectangles
- **Distance formula calculations** for both diagonals
- **Conclusion** showing AC = BD

## Strategic Placement Tips

1. Place one vertex at the origin (0, 0)
2. Align sides along the x-axis and y-axis
3. Use variables instead of specific numbers for generality
4. Keep the figure in the first quadrant for positive coordinates

## Learning Objectives

- **Apply** coordinate geometry formulas to prove geometric properties algebraically

## Bloom's Taxonomy Level

**Applying** - Using coordinate geometry formulas to prove properties.
