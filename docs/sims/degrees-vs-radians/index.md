## Description

This MicroSim illustrates the relationship between degrees and radians, the two most common ways to measure angles. A slider allows students to rotate a line around a circle while observing both the degree measurement and the radian measurement. Alternating colored arcs along the circumference show each radian segment, demonstrating that there are 2π (approximately 6.28) radians in a full circle.

## Sample Prompt

!!! prompt
    Please generate a new p5.js MicroSim that will be used in our high-school geometry textbook.  This MicroSim illustrates the different ways we measure angles comparing both degrees and radians.  There is a single slider that changes the angle of a line in a circle at the center of the drawing area.  As the slider moves, the line rotates around the circle.  The angle starts at 0 degrees and ends at 360 degrees.  Place alternating blue and orange segments arcs along the circumference are of distance 1 radian.  The diagram illustrates the fact that there are 2 pi radians in a circle.  The title is "Comparing Degrees and Radians".
