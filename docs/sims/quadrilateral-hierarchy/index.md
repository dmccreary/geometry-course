## About This MicroSim

This interactive diagram shows the family relationships among quadrilaterals. Arrows indicate "is a special type of" relationships, showing how more specific quadrilaterals inherit properties from more general ones.

## The Quadrilateral Family

| Type | Key Property |
|------|-------------|
| **Quadrilateral** | 4 sides, angles sum to 360° |
| **Trapezoid** | Exactly 1 pair of parallel sides |
| **Isosceles Trapezoid** | Trapezoid with equal legs |
| **Kite** | 2 pairs of consecutive equal sides |
| **Parallelogram** | 2 pairs of parallel sides |
| **Rectangle** | Parallelogram with 4 right angles |
| **Rhombus** | Parallelogram with 4 equal sides |
| **Square** | Both Rectangle AND Rhombus |

## Key Relationships

- A **Square** is both a Rectangle and a Rhombus
- All Rectangles, Rhombuses, and Squares are Parallelograms
- An Isosceles Trapezoid is a special Trapezoid
- Kites are NOT parallelograms (sides are not parallel)

## Interactions

- **Hover** over any shape to see its key property and a preview

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the hierarchy of quadrilateral classifications
- Recognize inheritance of properties from general to specific types
- Identify that a Square has all properties of both Rectangle and Rhombus
