## About This Diagram

This comprehensive visualization shows all four types of special segments in triangles along with their points of concurrency (where all three segments of each type meet).

## The Four Special Segments

| Segment | Definition | Point of Concurrency | Property |
|---------|------------|---------------------|----------|
| **Median** | Vertex to midpoint of opposite side | Centroid (G) | Balance point; divides each median 2:1 |
| **Altitude** | Perpendicular from vertex to opposite side | Orthocenter (H) | Location varies by triangle type |
| **Perpendicular Bisector** | ⊥ to side at its midpoint | Circumcenter (O) | Equidistant from all vertices |
| **Angle Bisector** | Bisects each angle | Incenter (I) | Equidistant from all sides |

## Points of Concurrency

### Centroid (G)
- Always **inside** the triangle
- "Balance point" - center of mass
- Divides each median in ratio **2:1** from vertex

### Orthocenter (H)
- **Inside** for acute triangles
- **On** the right-angle vertex for right triangles
- **Outside** for obtuse triangles

### Circumcenter (O)
- Center of the **circumscribed circle** (passes through all vertices)
- Equidistant from all three vertices

### Incenter (I)
- Always **inside** the triangle
- Center of the **inscribed circle** (touches all sides)
- Equidistant from all three sides
