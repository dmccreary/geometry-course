## About This MicroSim

This interactive quiz challenges students to classify angles by their measure. A random angle is displayed visually and students must identify whether it is acute (0°-90°), right (90°), obtuse (90°-180°), or straight (180°). Immediate feedback and score tracking reinforce learning.

## How to Use

1. Look at the angle displayed and its degree measure
2. Click the correct classification button (Acute, Right, Obtuse, or Straight)
3. See immediate feedback with explanation
4. Click "Next Angle" for a new challenge
5. Track your score in the top-right corner

## Lesson Plan

**Grade Level:** 9-12
**Duration:** 10-15 minutes
**Prerequisite:** Understanding of angle measurement in degrees

### Activities
1. **Warm-up:** Have students estimate angle measures before seeing the number
2. **Practice:** Work through 10-15 angles to build classification confidence
3. **Challenge:** Try to get a perfect score on 10 consecutive angles

### Assessment
- Students should achieve 80%+ accuracy on angle classification
- Students can articulate the boundary values (0°, 90°, 180°) for each type
