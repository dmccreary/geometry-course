## Description

The Angle Type Explorer allows students to interactively explore angle classifications by adjusting a slider from 0° to 180°. As the angle changes, students can observe how angles transition between acute (0°-90°), right (90°), obtuse (90°-180°), and straight (180°) classifications.

## Lesson Plan

**Grade Level:** High School Grade Geometry


### Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:

1. Identify and classify angles by their measurements (acute, right, obtuse, straight)
2. Understand the relationship between angle measures and their visual representations
3. Apply angle classification skills to solve real-world problems
4. Develop intuition for estimating angle measures

### Materials Needed
- Computer or tablet with internet access for each student (or pairs)
- Angle Explorer MicroSim
- Protractor (physical, optional)
- Student worksheet (provided below)
- Notebook for recording observations

### Vocabulary
- **Angle**: The figure formed by two rays sharing a common endpoint
- **Vertex**: The common endpoint of two rays forming an angle
- **Acute Angle**: An angle measuring between 0° and 90°
- **Right Angle**: An angle measuring exactly 90°
- **Obtuse Angle**: An angle measuring between 90° and 180°
- **Straight Angle**: An angle measuring exactly 180°

## Lesson Activities

### Part 1: Introduction

**Warm-Up Question:**
"Where do we see angles in everyday life?"

Expected responses: corners of buildings, scissors opening, clock hands, road intersections, etc.

**Brief Review:**
- Remind students that angles are measured in degrees
- A full rotation is 360°
- Review the basic angle types they learned in previous grades

### Part 2: Guided Exploration

**Activity 1: Discovering Angle Types**

Have students open the Angle Explorer MicroSim and work through these steps:

#### 1. **Zero Angle (0°)**

- Set the slider to 0°
- Observe: What do you notice about the two rays?
- Discussion: Are the rays overlapping?

#### 2. **Right Angle (90°)**

- Set the slider to exactly 90°
- Observe: How do the rays look in relation to each other?
- Real-world connection: Can you name objects that form right angles?

#### 3. **Straight Angle (180°)**

- Set the slider to 180°
- Observe: What happened to the angle?
- Discussion: How is this similar to a straight line?

#### 4. **Acute vs. Obtuse**

- Try 45° (acute) and 135° (obtuse)
- Compare: How are they different?
- Pattern: What happens at values between 0° and 90°? Between 90° and 180°?

#### Guided Questions

- "What happens to the red arc as you increase the angle?"
- "At what point does the angle change from acute to obtuse?"
- "Can you predict the angle type before checking the label?"

### Part 3: Independent Practice

**Activity 2: Estimation Challenge**

Students work individually or in pairs:

#### 1. **Estimation Round**

- Close your eyes while your partner sets the slider
- Open your eyes and estimate the angle (don't look at the number!)
- Check your estimate against the actual value
- Repeat 5 times, trying to get closer each time

#### 2. **Classification Challenge** 

- Set these angles and classify each one:
   - 23°, 67°, 90°, 112°, 158°, 0°, 45°, 135°, 180°
- Record your classifications
- Use the MicroSim to verify

#### 3. **Critical Thinking**
- What angle is exactly halfway between acute and obtuse?
- What angle divides the acute range in half?
- If an angle is 89°, how far is it from being a right angle?
- Challenge: Without using the sim, what angle is complementary to 65°? (Answer: 25°, since 65° + 25° = 90°)

### Part 4: Real-World Application

**Activity 3: Angles Around Us**

Brainstorm and sketch examples of each angle type found in:

1. **Architecture**: building corners, roof slopes, stairs
2. **Nature**: tree branches, mountain slopes, crystals
3. **Sports**: basketball shot trajectory, diving board angle
4. **Technology**: laptop screen opening, phone stand, tablet case

#### Discussion Questions:
- Why are right angles so common in construction?
- When might an architect intentionally use obtuse or acute angles?
- How do angles affect stability in structures?

### Part 5: Closure & Assessment

**Exit Ticket:**

Answer one of these questions in your notebook:

1. Explain in your own words: How can you tell if an angle is acute, right, or obtuse just by looking at it?
2. Give a real-world example of when knowing the exact angle measurement would be important.
3. What was the most surprising thing you learned about angles today?

## Assessment Rubric

### Formative Assessment (During Lesson)
- Observe student engagement with the MicroSim
- Monitor accuracy in the estimation challenge
- Check classification challenge answers
- Listen to pair discussions

### Summative Assessment (Exit Ticket)
- **Proficient**: Clear explanation with accurate terminology
- **Developing**: Partial understanding, some confusion
- **Beginning**: Significant misconceptions present

---

## Differentiation Strategies

### For Advanced Learners:

- Introduce reflex angles (180° - 360°) and challenge them to think about how the MicroSim could be modified
- Explore angle relationships: complementary (sum to 90°), supplementary (sum to 180°)
- Calculate angle measures in regular polygons

### For Struggling Learners:

- Provide a visual reference chart with angle types and examples
- Allow more time with the MicroSim during guided exploration
- Pair with a peer mentor for the estimation challenge
- Focus on identifying just three categories: acute, right, obtuse

### For English Language Learners:

- Pre-teach vocabulary with visual supports
- Provide sentence frames for discussions
- Use gestures to demonstrate angle opening and closing
- Create a bilingual vocabulary reference sheet

## Extension Activities

1. **Homework Assignment**: Find and photograph 5 different angles in your home. Estimate their measurements and classify them.

2. **STEM Connection**: Research how angles are used in engineering (bridge design, ramp slopes for accessibility, satellite dish positioning).

3. **Art Integration**: Create an artwork using only specific angle types (e.g., a design made entirely of acute angles).

4. **Technology Integration**: Learn about how the MicroSim was created using p5.js and try modifying the code to add new features.

## Teacher Notes

### Common Student Misconceptions:
- Confusing the length of the rays with the size of the angle
- Thinking angles must be oriented horizontally
- Believing obtuse angles are always "very close" to 180°

### Tips for Success:
- Circulate during the estimation challenge to provide immediate feedback
- Encourage students to verbalize their thinking process
- Use the MicroSim's visual feedback to reinforce correct classifications
- Connect to prior knowledge about fractions of a circle (e.g., 90° is 1/4 of 360°)

### Follow-Up Lessons:
- Angle relationships (vertical, adjacent, complementary, supplementary)
- Angles formed by parallel lines and transversals
- Angle measures in polygons
- Trigonometry introduction
