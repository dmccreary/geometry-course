## About This MicroSim

This interactive tool lets you explore the four types of angle relationships formed when a transversal crosses two parallel lines. Drag the red handle to rotate the transversal and watch all eight angles update in real time. Click the color-coded buttons to highlight each relationship type and see the equations that prove the relationship holds for any transversal angle.

## How to Use

1. **Drag the red handle** to rotate the transversal and change all eight angle measures
2. **Click a relationship button** to highlight the relevant angle pairs with color-coded arcs
3. **Read the info panel** (lower-left) to see the equations and property for each relationship
4. **Click Reset** to clear all highlighting
5. **Observe** that the relationships hold no matter how you tilt the transversal

## Angle Relationships

| Relationship | Pairs | Property |
|--------------|-------|----------|
| **Corresponding** | 1 & 5, 2 & 6, 3 & 7, 4 & 8 | Congruent |
| **Alt. Interior** | 3 & 6, 4 & 5 | Congruent |
| **Alt. Exterior** | 1 & 8, 2 & 7 | Congruent |
| **Same-Side Interior** | 3 & 5, 4 & 6 | Supplementary (180) |

## Key Insight

When parallel lines are cut by a transversal:

- Three relationship types produce **congruent** (equal) angle pairs
- One relationship type produces **supplementary** (sum to 180) angle pairs
- These properties hold for **every** transversal angle

## Learning Objectives

- **Identify** the four angle relationship types formed by parallel lines and a transversal
- **Verify** that corresponding, alternate interior, and alternate exterior angles are congruent
- **Verify** that same-side interior angles are supplementary
- **Evaluate** how all relationships hold as the transversal angle changes

## Bloom's Taxonomy Level

**Analyzing** and **Evaluating** - Identifying angle relationships and verifying their properties through interactive exploration.
