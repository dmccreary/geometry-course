## About This MicroSim

This interactive diagram teaches the fundamental parts of an angle and proper angle notation. Hover over each component to learn about its role and how to name angles correctly.

## Angle Components

- **Vertex (B)** - The common endpoint where both rays meet
- **Side BA** - One of the two rays forming the angle (blue)
- **Side BC** - The other ray forming the angle (red)
- **Angle Arc** - Shows the opening between the rays

## How to Use

- **Hover** over any part of the angle to see its description
- The info panel updates with relevant details
- Learn the different ways to name an angle

## Angle Notation

| Notation | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| ∠ABC | Full angle name (vertex in middle) |
| ∠CBA | Same angle, reverse order |
| ∠B | Vertex-only notation |
| m∠ABC = 45° | The measure of the angle |

## Key Rule

**The vertex is always in the middle of the angle name!**

## Learning Objectives

- **Identify** the vertex and sides of an angle
- **Apply** proper angle notation
- **Understand** measurement notation

## Bloom's Taxonomy Level

**Remembering** - Identifying and labeling angle parts.
