## About This MicroSim

This interactive visualization demonstrates the **orthocenter** of a triangle - the intersection point of the three altitudes. The orthocenter has fascinating properties related to triangle type and lies on the famous Euler line.

## Key Concepts

### Altitudes
An **altitude** is a line segment from a vertex perpendicular to the opposite side (or its extension). Every triangle has exactly three altitudes.

### The Orthocenter (H)
- The orthocenter is where all three altitudes meet
- Its location depends dramatically on triangle type:
  - **Acute triangle**: Inside the triangle
  - **Right triangle**: At the vertex of the right angle
  - **Obtuse triangle**: Outside the triangle

### Properties
- The orthocenter lies on the **Euler line**
- In a right triangle, H coincides with the right-angle vertex
- The reflection of H over each side lies on the circumcircle

## Interactions

- **Drag vertices** A, B, or C to reshape the triangle
- **Watch** how the orthocenter dramatically moves as the triangle type changes
- **Observe** the right angle markers at each altitude foot

## Learning Objectives

- Understand that altitudes are perpendicular to opposite sides
- Identify the orthocenter as the intersection of altitudes
- Recognize how orthocenter location varies with triangle type
- Connect the orthocenter to special triangle properties
