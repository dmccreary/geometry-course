## About This MicroSim

This interactive visualization demonstrates the **Inscribed Angle Theorem**:

> An inscribed angle is half the measure of the central angle that intercepts the same arc.

## Key Concepts

- **Central Angle** (blue): An angle with its vertex at the center of the circle
- **Inscribed Angle** (red): An angle with its vertex on the circle
- **Intercepted Arc** (yellow): The arc between the two points where the angle's sides meet the circle

## The Theorem

$$m\angle_{inscribed} = \frac{1}{2} \times m\angle_{central}$$

When both angles intercept the same arc:
- If the central angle is 90°, the inscribed angle is 45°
- If the central angle is 120°, the inscribed angle is 60°
- If the central angle is 180° (semicircle), the inscribed angle is 90°

## Special Case: Angle in a Semicircle

When the central angle is 180° (a diameter), the inscribed angle is always 90°. This is called **Thales' theorem** - any angle inscribed in a semicircle is a right angle.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the relationship between central and inscribed angles
- Apply the inscribed angle theorem to find unknown angle measures
- Recognize that inscribed angles intercepting the same arc are equal
