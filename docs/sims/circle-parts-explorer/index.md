## About This MicroSim

This interactive visualization demonstrates the fundamental parts of a circle:

- **Center** (red dot) - The fixed point from which all points on the circle are equidistant
- **Radius** (green/purple lines) - The distance from center to any point on the circle
- **Diameter** (orange line) - A chord passing through the center; equals 2 × radius
- **Chord** (blue line) - A line segment with both endpoints on the circle

## Key Relationships

| Measurement | Formula |
|-------------|---------|
| Diameter | d = 2r |
| Circumference | C = 2πr = πd |
| Area | A = πr² |

## Important Facts

- The **diameter** is the longest possible chord in a circle
- All radii of a circle are equal in length
- The diameter is twice the radius (d = 2r)
- Every chord divides the circle into two arcs

## Learning Objectives

- Identify and label the basic components of a circle
- Understand the relationship between radius and diameter
- Calculate circumference and area using formulas

## Bloom's Taxonomy Level
