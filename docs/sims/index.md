## Using MicroSims in the Classroom

MicroSims (micro-simulations) are interactive visualizations that help students explore geometric concepts through hands-on manipulation and immediate visual feedback.

### Learning Objectives

By using MicroSims, students will be able to:

- Visualize abstract geometric concepts through interactive manipulation
- Discover geometric relationships through exploration and experimentation
- Connect formal definitions to visual representations
- Develop intuition about geometric properties and relationships

### Instructional Strategies

1. **Guided Exploration**: Demonstrate the MicroSim and guide initial exploration with questions
2. **Discovery Learning**: Allow students to discover relationships independently
3. **Concept Reinforcement**: Connect exploration to formal definitions and theorems

### Best Practices

- Allow time for free exploration before structured tasks
- Encourage students to make and test predictions
- Use MicroSims to supplement, not replace, traditional instruction
- Connect virtual manipulations to real-world applications
