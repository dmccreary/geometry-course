## About This Diagram

This comparison diagram explains the fundamental difference between a ruler and a straightedge, and why classical geometric constructions use only a straightedge.

## Key Differences

| Tool | Markings | Use in Constructions |
|------|----------|---------------------|
| **Ruler** | Has numbered measurements | ✗ NOT allowed |
| **Straightedge** | No markings | ✓ USED |

## Why the Distinction Matters

**Rulers** rely on numerical measurements which:
- Depend on arbitrary units (inches, cm, etc.)
- Cannot express pure geometric relationships

**Straightedges** can only:
- Draw lines through two given points
- Create relationships based on geometry, not numbers

## How to Use

1. **Hover over each panel** to highlight that tool
2. **Compare the explanations** for why one is allowed and one isn't
3. **Notice** the straightedge is used to draw a line through points A and B

## Learning Objectives

- **Understand** the difference between a straightedge and a ruler
- **Analyze** why constructions use straightedges instead of rulers
- **Recognize** that geometric relationships are independent of measurement units

## Bloom's Taxonomy Level

**Understanding** and **Analyzing** - Distinguishing between tools and their purposes.
