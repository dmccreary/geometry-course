## About This MicroSim

The **nine-point circle** (also called the Euler circle or Feuerbach circle) is one of the most elegant discoveries in triangle geometry. It passes through exactly nine significant points associated with any triangle.

## The Nine Points

| Group | Points | Color |
|-------|--------|-------|
| **Midpoints of sides** | 3 points | Blue |
| **Feet of altitudes** | 3 points | Red |
| **Midpoints from vertices to orthocenter** | 3 points | Orange |

## Key Properties

### The Nine-Point Center (N)
- Located exactly **midway between the orthocenter (H) and circumcenter (O)**
- Lies on the **Euler line**

### The Nine-Point Radius
The radius of the nine-point circle is exactly **half the circumradius**:

$$r_9 = \frac{R}{2}$$

### Historical Significance
This remarkable circle was discovered independently by several mathematicians in the early 19th century, including Feuerbach, Brianchon, and Poncelet.

## Interactions

- **Drag vertices** to reshape the triangle
- **Toggle buttons** to show/hide each group of three points
- **Observe** all nine points remaining on the circle

## Learning Objectives

- Identify the nine special points on the nine-point circle
- Understand that N is the midpoint of segment OH
- Recognize that the nine-point radius equals half the circumradius
- Appreciate this elegant geometric relationship
