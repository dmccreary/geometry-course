## Description

This MicroSim allows students to explore the four related forms of any conditional statement: the **original conditional**, **converse**, **inverse**, and **contrapositive**. Students cycle through 10 geometric conditional statements and see each form automatically generated in a color-coded 2x2 grid.

Key features:

- **Four statement boxes** display the original, converse, inverse, and contrapositive with symbolic notation and verbal phrasing
- **Truth value indicators** show whether each form is true or false for the given geometric context
- **Connection lines** highlight that the original and contrapositive are always logically equivalent, and the converse and inverse are equivalent to each other
- **10 geometric examples** ranging from biconditionals (all four true) to statements where the converse is false
- **Toggle controls** let students hide connections or truth values to test their own predictions before revealing answers

## How to Use

1. Click **Next** or **Prev** to cycle through the 10 example statements
2. Click **New Random** to jump to a random statement
3. Toggle **Show Truth Values** off to predict truth values before checking
4. Toggle **Show Connections** to see which statement pairs are logically equivalent
5. Notice that the original and contrapositive always share the same truth value

## Lesson Plan

### Learning Objective

Students will be able to create converse, inverse, and contrapositive statements from any given conditional statement and test their truth values (Bloom's Taxonomy: Creating).

### Activities

1. **Predict and Check** (10 min): Turn off truth values. For each statement, have students write the converse, inverse, and contrapositive on paper, predict which are true, then toggle truth values on to check.

2. **Pattern Discovery** (10 min): Cycle through all 10 statements and have students record which statements have all four forms true. Ask: "What makes these statements special?" (Answer: They are biconditional/definitions.)

3. **Counterexample Hunt** (10 min): For statements where the converse is false, have students identify a specific geometric counterexample. For example, statement 2: "A rectangle has four right angles but is not a square."

4. **Create Your Own** (15 min): Have students write their own geometric conditional statements, determine all four forms, and evaluate truth values using the patterns they observed.

### Assessment

- Can the student correctly form all four related statements from a given conditional?
- Can the student determine truth values and provide counterexamples for false forms?
- Does the student understand that the original and contrapositive are always logically equivalent?

### Prerequisites

- Understanding of conditional statements (if-then form)
- Familiarity with basic geometric vocabulary (triangle, quadrilateral, angle types)
- Knowledge of negation in logic
