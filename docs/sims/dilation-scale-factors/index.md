## About This Diagram

This diagram shows how dilations change the size of a figure while preserving its shape. Click different scale factors to see enlargements and reductions.

## Scale Factor Effects

| Scale Factor | Effect | Example |
|--------------|--------|---------|
| **k > 1** | Enlargement | k = 2 doubles size |
| **k = 1** | No change | Identity |
| **0 < k < 1** | Reduction | k = 0.5 halves size |

## Visual Elements

- **Red dot**: Center of dilation
- **Blue triangle**: Pre-image
- **Green triangle**: Image (dilated)
- **Dashed lines**: Radial lines from center through vertices
- **Distance labels**: Show proportional changes

## Key Concepts

- All points move along lines through the center
- Distances are multiplied by scale factor k
- Shape is preserved, but size changes
- **Dilations are NOT rigid motions!**

## Coordinate Rule

(x, y) → (kx, ky) when center is at origin

## Interaction

Click "k = 2", "k = 0.5", or "k = 1.5" to animate each dilation.

## Learning Objectives

- **Understand** how scale factor affects size
- **Apply** dilation rules to coordinates

## Bloom's Taxonomy Level

**Understanding** and **Applying** - Visualizing dilations.
