## About This MicroSim

This interactive visualization demonstrates the **Euler line** - one of the most remarkable discoveries in triangle geometry. Named after Leonhard Euler (1707-1783), this line passes through three important triangle centers.

## Key Concepts

### The Euler Line
In any non-equilateral triangle, the following three points are **collinear** (lie on the same line):
- **G** - Centroid (intersection of medians)
- **O** - Circumcenter (intersection of perpendicular bisectors)
- **H** - Orthocenter (intersection of altitudes)

### The 2:1 Ratio
The centroid G divides the segment from O to H in the ratio **1:2**:
- Distance OG : Distance GH = 1 : 2
- The centroid is located 1/3 of the way from O to H

### Special Cases
- **Equilateral triangle**: All four centers (including incenter) coincide at a single point
- The incenter generally does NOT lie on the Euler line

## Interactions

- **Drag vertices** A, B, or C to reshape the triangle
- **Watch** the three centers move along the Euler line
- **Verify** the 1:2 ratio labels between O, G, and H

## Learning Objectives

- Understand that G, O, and H are always collinear (except equilateral)
- Apply the 2:1 ratio property of the Euler line
- Recognize how center positions change while maintaining collinearity
- Appreciate the elegant mathematical relationship
