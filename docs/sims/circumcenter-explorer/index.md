## About This MicroSim

This interactive visualization demonstrates the **circumcenter** of a triangle - the intersection point of the three perpendicular bisectors. The circumcenter is the center of the circumscribed circle (circumcircle) that passes through all three vertices.

## Key Concepts

### Perpendicular Bisectors
A **perpendicular bisector** of a side is a line that:
- Passes through the midpoint of the side
- Is perpendicular (90°) to the side

### The Circumcenter (O)
- The circumcenter is **equidistant from all three vertices**
- It is the center of the **circumcircle** (the circle through all vertices)
- Its location depends on the triangle type:
  - **Acute triangle**: Inside the triangle
  - **Right triangle**: On the hypotenuse (at its midpoint)
  - **Obtuse triangle**: Outside the triangle

## Interactions

- **Drag vertices** A, B, or C to reshape the triangle
- **Watch** how the circumcenter moves as the triangle type changes
- **Observe** the circumcircle always passing through all three vertices

## Learning Objectives

- Understand that perpendicular bisectors meet at a single point
- Identify the circumcenter as equidistant from all vertices
- Recognize how circumcenter location varies with triangle type
- Connect the circumcenter to the circumscribed circle
