## Description

This MicroSim provides a comprehensive visual reference for area formulas of six common quadrilaterals: rectangle, square, parallelogram, trapezoid, rhombus, and kite. Each quadrilateral is displayed in its own color-coded panel with:

- A visual representation of the shape
- Key dimensions labeled (base, height, diagonals)
- The mathematical formula for calculating area
- Color-coded backgrounds for easy identification

The display is fully responsive and adapts to different screen widths, making it suitable for use on tablets, laptops, and interactive whiteboards.

### Key Features

- **Rectangle**: Shows length (l) and width (w) with formula A = lw
- **Square**: Shows side length (s) with formula A = s²
- **Parallelogram**: Shows base (b) and height (h) with dashed height line and formula A = bh
- **Trapezoid**: Shows both bases (b₁, b₂) and height (h) with formula A = ½(b₁ + b₂)h
- **Rhombus**: Shows both diagonals (d₁, d₂) as dashed lines with formula A = ½d₁d₂
- **Kite**: Shows both diagonals (d₁, d₂) with formula A = ½d₁d₂

## Learning Objectives

Students will **remember** area formulas for rectangles, squares, parallelograms, trapezoids, rhombuses, and kites, and **understand** how these formulas relate to the base rectangle formula. (Bloom's Taxonomy: Remembering, Understanding)

## Educational Use

This MicroSim is designed for:

- **Quick reference** during problem-solving activities
- **Visual learning** to connect formulas with geometric shapes
- **Comparison** to understand relationships between different quadrilateral area formulas
- **Study aid** for memorizing formulas

### Suggested Activities

1. **Formula Comparison**: Have students identify which formulas are related and explain why (e.g., rhombus and kite both use ½d₁d₂)
2. **Dimension Identification**: Ask students to identify which dimensions are needed for each formula
3. **Application Practice**: Provide actual measurements and have students calculate areas using the formulas shown
4. **Relationship Exploration**: Discuss how the rectangle formula (A = lw) is the foundation for other formulas

## Lesson Plan

### Grade Level
High School Geometry (Grades 9-12)

### Duration
10-15 minutes for initial reference, ongoing use during area unit

### Prerequisites
- Understanding of quadrilateral definitions
- Basic measurement concepts (length, width, height)
- Basic algebraic notation

### Pedagogical Notes

This MicroSim serves as a visual reference guide rather than an interactive simulation. Its value lies in:

1. **Visual-spatial learning**: Connecting abstract formulas with concrete shapes
2. **Pattern recognition**: Seeing similarities and differences among formulas
3. **Cognitive scaffolding**: Providing a reference that reduces working memory load
4. **Comparative analysis**: Enabling students to see all six formulas simultaneously

### Integration Tips

- Display on classroom screen during area calculation activities
- Reference when introducing each new quadrilateral type
- Use as a study guide for assessments
- Embed in digital textbooks or learning management systems

## Technical Details

- **Framework**: P5.js 1.11.10
- **Responsive**: Width-responsive design adapts to container
- **Height**: 410px (fixed)
- **Interactive Elements**: None (static visual reference)
- **Accessibility**: Includes ARIA description for screen readers
