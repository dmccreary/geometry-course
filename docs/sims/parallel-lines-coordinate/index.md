## About This Diagram

This diagram shows three parallel lines in the coordinate plane, demonstrating that parallel lines have equal slopes but different y-intercepts. Hover over any line to highlight it.

## Lines Shown

| Line | Equation | Slope (m) | Y-intercept (b) |
|------|----------|-----------|-----------------|
| 1 | y = 2x + 4 | 2 | 4 |
| 2 | y = 2x | 2 | 0 |
| 3 | y = 2x - 3 | 2 | -3 |

## Key Observations

- All three lines have the **same slope** (m = 2)
- They have **different y-intercepts** (b = 4, 0, -3)
- The lines **never intersect**
- They remain the same distance apart throughout

## Parallel Lines Theorem

Two non-vertical lines are parallel if and only if they have equal slopes:
**m₁ = m₂**

## Learning Objectives

- **Understand** that parallel lines have equal slopes
- **Apply** the parallel lines theorem to identify parallel lines

## Bloom's Taxonomy Level

**Understanding** and **Applying** - Slope comparison and identification.
