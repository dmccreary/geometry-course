## About This MicroSim

This interactive visualization demonstrates the relationship between two similar triangles. Use the slider to adjust the scale factor and observe how:

- Corresponding sides maintain proportional relationships
- Corresponding angles remain equal (shown with matching color markers)
- The area scales by the square of the scale factor (k²)

## Key Concepts

**Similar Triangles** have:
- All corresponding angles congruent (equal)
- All corresponding sides proportional (same ratio)

**Scale Factor (k)**:
- k > 1: The second triangle is an enlargement
- k < 1: The second triangle is a reduction
- k = 1: The triangles are congruent

## Mathematical Relationships

For similar triangles △ABC ~ △DEF with scale factor k:

- DE/AB = EF/BC = DF/AC = k (sides are proportional)
- ∠A = ∠D, ∠B = ∠E, ∠C = ∠F (angles are equal)
- Area(△DEF)/Area(△ABC) = k²

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the definition of similar figures
- Apply scale factors to find corresponding side lengths
- Recognize the relationship between scale factor and area ratio

## Bloom's Taxonomy Level
