## About This Diagram

This three-panel visualization demonstrates the SSS (Side-Side-Side) Congruence Postulate, showing how three pairs of congruent sides uniquely determine a triangle and guarantee congruence.

## Panel Descriptions

### Panel 1: Given Information
Shows two triangles with three pairs of marked congruent sides:
- AB ≅ DE = 5 cm (one tick mark)
- BC ≅ EF = 7 cm (two tick marks)
- AC ≅ DF = 6 cm (three tick marks)

### Panel 2: Construction Process
Demonstrates why three sides uniquely determine a triangle:
- Start with base segment DE (5 cm)
- Draw arc from D with radius 6 cm
- Draw arc from E with radius 7 cm
- The arcs intersect at exactly ONE point (F)

### Panel 3: Result
Shows the triangles overlapping perfectly, proving congruence through rigid motion.

## SSS Congruence Postulate

**If three sides of one triangle are congruent to three sides of another triangle, then the triangles are congruent.**

In symbols: If AB ≅ DE, BC ≅ EF, and AC ≅ DF, then △ABC ≅ △DEF
