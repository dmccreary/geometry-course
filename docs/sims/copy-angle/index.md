## About This MicroSim

This interactive tutorial demonstrates the classical compass and straightedge construction for copying an angle. Adjust the slider to try different starting angles.

## Construction Steps

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| **1** | Draw ray DE (one side of new angle) |
| **2** | Draw arc from B intersecting both rays at P and Q |
| **3** | Draw arc from D with same radius |
| **4** | Measure distance PQ with compass |
| **5** | Draw arc from E' with radius = PQ to find F |
| **6** | Draw ray DF - the angle is copied! |

## How to Use

1. **Adjust the slider** to change the original angle (20° to 140°)
2. **Click "Next"** to advance through steps
3. **Click "Auto"** to watch the animation
4. **Click "Reset"** to start over

## Why It Works

The construction uses arcs to preserve distances:
- The first arc ensures equal distances from the vertices
- The second arc preserves the "opening" of the angle (distance PQ)
- Together, they guarantee the new angle has the same measure

## Learning Objectives

- **Perform** angle copying construction
- **Analyze** how arcs determine angle congruence
- **Apply** compass techniques for precision

## Bloom's Taxonomy Level

**Applying** and **Analyzing** - Performing construction and understanding the method.
