## About This Diagram

This diagram illustrates the structure of **conditional statements** (if-then statements) in logic and geometry. Every conditional statement has two parts:

1. **Hypothesis (p)** - The "IF" part, which is the condition or given information
2. **Conclusion (q)** - The "THEN" part, which is what follows or results

## Notation

The conditional statement "If p, then q" is written symbolically as:

$$p \rightarrow q$$

This reads as "p implies q" or "if p, then q."

## Learning Objectives

After studying this diagram, students will be able to:

- **Identify** the hypothesis and conclusion in conditional statements
- **Understand** the structure of if-then statements
- **Apply** proper notation for conditional statements

## Bloom's Taxonomy Level

**Understanding** - Students comprehend the components of conditional statements.

## Lesson Plan

### Grade Level
9-12 (High School Geometry)

### Duration
5-10 minutes

### Activities

1. **Identification Practice**: Given several conditional statements, have students identify the hypothesis and conclusion.

2. **Statement Writing**: Have students write their own conditional statements about geometric concepts.

### Assessment
- Can students correctly identify the hypothesis in a conditional statement?
- Can students correctly identify the conclusion?
