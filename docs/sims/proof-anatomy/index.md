## About This MicroSim

This interactive diagram shows the three essential components that every geometric proof must contain:

1. **GIVEN** - The starting information (what you know)
2. **LOGICAL STEPS** - The journey of valid deductions (each justified)
3. **PROVE** - The destination (what you demonstrate)

## How to Use

- **Hover** over each section to see more details and examples
- Hover over the **Tools** box to see what resources are available for proofs
- Follow the arrows from START to FINISH

## Key Insight

**Every step in a proof must be justified!**

Valid reasons include:
- Postulates (accepted truths)
- Definitions
- Previously proven theorems
- Algebraic properties

## Learning Objectives

- **Understand** the essential components of a geometric proof
- **Identify** the Given, Steps, and Prove in any proof format
- **Recognize** that all proof formats share this structure

## Bloom's Taxonomy Level

**Understanding** - Comprehending the structure of proofs.
