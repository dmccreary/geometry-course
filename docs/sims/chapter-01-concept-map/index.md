## About This MicroSim

This interactive concept map visualizes all 19 key concepts from Chapter 1 - Foundations of Geometry. The map shows how concepts are related and organized into categories.

## How to Use

- **Hover** over any concept to see its definition
- **Drag** nodes to rearrange the layout
- **Zoom** using scroll wheel or pinch gestures
- **Click and drag** the background to pan

## Concept Categories

| Color | Category | Concepts |
|-------|----------|----------|
| Dark Blue | Hub | Foundations of Geometry |
| Red | Undefined Terms | Point, Line, Plane |
| Blue | Basic Objects | Ray, Segment, Angle, Vertex, Midpoint, Intersection |
| Green | Relationships | Collinear, Coplanar, Parallel, Perpendicular, Skew |
| Orange | Reasoning | Inductive, Deductive, Conjecture, Counterexample |

## Learning Objectives

After exploring this concept map, students will be able to:

- **Remember** key definitions and terms from Chapter 1
- **Understand** how concepts relate to each other
- **Evaluate** their own understanding of the material
- **Identify** gaps in their knowledge

## Bloom's Taxonomy Level

- **Remembering** - Recalling key definitions
- **Evaluating** - Assessing understanding of concept relationships

## Lesson Plan

### Grade Level
9-12 (High School Geometry)

### Duration
10-15 minutes

### Prerequisites
- Completion of Chapter 1 reading

### Activities

1. **Self-Assessment** (5 min): Students hover over each concept and mentally test whether they can define it before seeing the tooltip.

2. **Connection Tracing** (5 min): Students follow the edges to understand how concepts build upon each other.

3. **Missing Link Game** (5 min): Cover the concept map and ask students to recreate the connections on paper.

### Assessment
- Can students explain why concepts are connected?
- Can students identify which category each concept belongs to?
- Can students trace the path from undefined terms to complex relationships?
