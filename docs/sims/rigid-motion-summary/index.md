## About This Diagram

This diagram compares the three rigid motions side-by-side: translation (slide), rotation (turn), and reflection (flip). Click each card to animate the transformation.

## Rigid Motions Comparison

| Property | Translation | Rotation | Reflection |
|----------|-------------|----------|------------|
| **Distance** | ✓ Preserved | ✓ Preserved | ✓ Preserved |
| **Angle** | ✓ Preserved | ✓ Preserved | ✓ Preserved |
| **Orientation** | ✓ Preserved | ✓ Preserved | ✗ Reversed |

## Key Concepts

- **Rigid motions** preserve distance and angle measure
- Also called **isometries**
- Two figures are **congruent** if one can be mapped to the other by rigid motions
- **Reflection** is the only rigid motion that reverses orientation

## Why Dilation is NOT Rigid

Dilations change distances (size), so they do NOT preserve distance and therefore are NOT rigid motions.

## Interaction

Click on "Translation", "Rotation", or "Reflection" cards to animate each transformation.

## Learning Objectives

- **Understand** what properties rigid motions preserve
- **Analyze** differences between the three rigid motions
- **Evaluate** why dilation is not a rigid motion

## Bloom's Taxonomy Level

**Understanding**, **Analyzing**, and **Evaluating** - Comparing transformations.
