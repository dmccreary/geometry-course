## About This MicroSim

This interactive gallery displays five fundamental geometric postulates with visual representations:

1. **Two Points → One Line**: Through any two points, there exists exactly one line
2. **Points in Plane → Line in Plane**: If two points lie in a plane, the line through them lies in the plane
3. **Three Points → One Plane**: Through any three non-collinear points, there exists exactly one plane
4. **Lines Intersect at One Point**: Two lines intersect at exactly one point
5. **Parallel Postulate**: Through a point not on a line, there is exactly one parallel line

## How to Use

- **Hover** over panels to highlight them
- **Click** panels to select and examine them more closely
- Study the visual representation and annotation for each postulate

## What are Postulates?

Postulates (or axioms) are statements accepted as true **without proof**. They form the foundation upon which all geometric theorems are built.

## Learning Objectives

- **Remember** the five fundamental geometric postulates
- **Recognize** visual representations of each postulate
- **Recall** these foundations when building geometric proofs

## Bloom's Taxonomy Level

**Remembering** - Recalling fundamental geometric postulates.
