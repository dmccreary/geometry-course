## About This MicroSim

This interactive concept map visualizes all 18 key concepts from Chapter 1 -- Foundations of Geometry. The map uses a hub-and-spoke layout to show how concepts are organized into four categories and how they depend on each other.

## How to Use

- **Click** any concept node to see its full definition, examples, and related concepts
- **Hover** over a concept to see a short definition tooltip and enlarge the node
- **Drag** nodes to rearrange the layout
- **Zoom** using the scroll wheel or pinch gestures
- **Filter** using the colored buttons to focus on a specific category
- **Click background** to deselect and reset the view

## Concept Categories

| Color | Category | Concepts |
|-------|----------|----------|
| Dark Blue | Hub | Foundations of Geometry |
| Red | Undefined Terms | Point, Line, Plane |
| Blue | Basic Objects | Ray, Line Segment, Angle, Vertex, Midpoint, Intersection |
| Green | Relationships | Collinear Points, Coplanar Points, Parallel Lines, Perpendicular Lines, Skew Lines |
| Orange | Reasoning | Inductive Reasoning, Deductive Reasoning, Conjecture, Counterexample |

## Learning Objectives

After exploring this concept map, students will be able to:

- **Remember** key definitions and terms from Chapter 1
- **Understand** how foundational concepts relate to each other
- **Evaluate** their own understanding of the material by tracing concept dependencies

## Bloom's Taxonomy Level

- **Remembering** -- Recalling key definitions
- **Evaluating** -- Assessing understanding of concept relationships

## Lesson Plan

### Grade Level
9-12 (High School Geometry)

### Duration
10-15 minutes

### Prerequisites
- Completion of Chapter 1 reading

### Activities

1. **Self-Assessment** (5 min): Click each concept and test whether you can define it before reading the definition panel.

2. **Connection Tracing** (5 min): Follow the edges to understand how concepts build on each other. Notice how everything traces back to the three undefined terms.

3. **Category Filtering** (5 min): Use the colored buttons to focus on one category at a time and explain why concepts are grouped together.

### Assessment
- Can students explain why concepts are connected by specific edges?
- Can students identify which category each concept belongs to?
- Can students trace the path from undefined terms to complex relationships?
