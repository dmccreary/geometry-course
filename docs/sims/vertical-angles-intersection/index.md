## About This MicroSim

This static diagram illustrates how vertical angles are formed when two lines intersect. The four angles are labeled and color-coded to show the two pairs of vertical angles, demonstrating that vertical angles are always congruent.

## Key Concepts

- Two intersecting lines create four angles at the point of intersection
- **Vertical angles** are the pairs of opposite angles (∠1 & ∠3, ∠2 & ∠4)
- Vertical angles are always congruent (equal in measure)
- Adjacent angles at an intersection are always supplementary (sum to 180°)

## Lesson Plan

**Grade Level:** 9-12
**Duration:** 5-10 minutes
**Prerequisite:** Understanding of angles and angle measurement

### Activities
1. Identify which pairs of angles are vertical angles
2. Verify that vertical angle pairs have equal measures
3. Verify that adjacent angle pairs sum to 180°
