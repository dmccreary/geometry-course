## About This MicroSim

This interactive flowchart diagram shows the three essential components that every geometric proof must contain, regardless of format:

1. **GIVEN** - The known information you start with (starting flag)
2. **LOGICAL STEPS** - A series of valid deductions, each with a Statement and Reason
3. **PROVE (Conclusion)** - What you end with (finish flag)

A **Toolbox** panel on the right lists the tools available for justifying proof steps: Postulates, Definitions, Previously Proven Theorems, Algebraic Properties, and Logical Reasoning Rules.

## How to Use

- **Hover** over each section to see more details and examples
- Follow the large arrows from **START** (green) to **FINISH** (purple)
- Note how each logical step box contains both a **Statement** and a **Reason**
- Review the Toolbox to see what kinds of justifications are valid in proofs

## Key Insight

The format of a proof (two-column, paragraph, flow chart, indirect, or coordinate) may vary, but these three components are always present. Every step in the middle must be justified with a valid reason.

## Learning Objectives

- **Understand** the essential components of a geometric proof
- **Identify** the Given, Logical Steps, and Prove in any proof format
- **Recognize** that all proof formats share this universal structure

## Bloom's Taxonomy Level

**Understanding** - Identifying the essential components of a geometric proof.
