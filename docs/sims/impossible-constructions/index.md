## About This Infographic

This interactive infographic explores the three famous classical problems that mathematicians proved cannot be solved using only compass and straightedge:

1. **Squaring the Circle** - Constructing a square with the same area as a given circle
2. **Doubling the Cube** - Constructing a cube with twice the volume
3. **Trisecting an Angle** - Dividing any arbitrary angle into three equal parts

## Why Are They Impossible?

These problems are not just "very hard" — they are **mathematically proven impossible** with compass and straightedge alone. The proofs involve showing that certain numbers (like ∛2 or √π) cannot be constructed.

| Problem | Year Proved | Mathematician | Key Obstacle |
|---------|-------------|---------------|--------------|
| Squaring the Circle | 1882 | Lindemann | π is transcendental |
| Doubling the Cube | 1837 | Wantzel | ∛2 is not constructible |
| Trisecting an Angle | 1837 | Wantzel | Requires solving cubic equations |

## How to Use

1. **Hover over each card** to see a preview
2. **Click any card** to read detailed information
3. **Learn the history** of each problem
4. **Discover fun facts** about these ancient challenges

## Important Note

These problems **CAN** be solved with other tools:
- A marked ruler (neusis construction)
- Origami
- Special curves (quadratrix, conchoid)

The impossibility is specific to the restricted tools of compass and straightedge!

## Learning Objectives

- **Understand** the historical significance of construction problems
- **Recognize** that some problems are mathematically impossible
- **Appreciate** the limits of compass and straightedge constructions

## Bloom's Taxonomy Level

**Understanding** and **Evaluating** - Understanding impossibility proofs and historical context.
