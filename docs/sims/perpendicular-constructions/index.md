## About This Diagram

This comparison shows the two types of perpendicular constructions:
1. **Through a point ON the line** - Point P is on line ℓ
2. **From a point TO the line** - Point P is not on line ℓ

Hover over each panel to see the construction steps.

## Key Differences

| Type | Given | Goal |
|------|-------|------|
| **ON Line** | Point P is on ℓ | Construct line through P perpendicular to ℓ |
| **TO Line** | Point P is off ℓ | Construct line from P perpendicular to ℓ |

## When to Use Each

- **ON Line**: When you need a perpendicular at a specific point on a line
- **TO Line**: When you need the shortest distance from a point to a line

## How to Use

1. **Hover over the left panel** to see "perpendicular through point ON line"
2. **Hover over the right panel** to see "perpendicular from point TO line"
3. **Compare the steps** listed below each diagram

## Learning Objectives

- **Distinguish** between the two perpendicular construction methods
- **Apply** the appropriate construction based on point location
- **Analyze** why each construction produces a perpendicular

## Bloom's Taxonomy Level

**Understanding**, **Applying**, and **Analyzing** - Distinguishing and applying constructions.
