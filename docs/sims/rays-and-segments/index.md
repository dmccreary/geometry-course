## About This MicroSim

This diagram provides a visual comparison of two fundamental geometric concepts: **rays** and **line segments**. Understanding the differences between these is essential for studying geometry.

## Key Differences

| Feature | Ray | Line Segment |
|---------|-----|--------------|
| Endpoints | One endpoint | Two endpoints |
| Extension | Extends infinitely in one direction | Fixed, finite length |
| Notation | Arrow over letters ($\overrightarrow{AB}$) | Line over letters ($\overline{PQ}$) |
| Measurement | Cannot measure length (infinite) | Has measurable length |

## Learning Objectives

After studying this diagram, students will be able to:

- **Understand** the differences between rays and line segments
- **Identify** the visual representations of each
- **Recognize** the notation used for rays versus segments
- **Apply** this knowledge when reading geometric diagrams

## Bloom's Taxonomy Level

**Understanding** - Students comprehend the distinctions between rays and line segments by comparing their visual representations and properties.

## Lesson Plan

### Grade Level
9-12 (High School Geometry)

### Duration
5-10 minutes

### Prerequisites
- Understanding of points and lines
- Basic geometric terminology

### Activities

1. **Observation** (2 min): Have students examine the diagram and identify the key visual differences between the two panels.

2. **Notation Practice** (3 min): Ask students to practice writing ray notation ($\overrightarrow{AB}$) and segment notation ($\overline{PQ}$) for given examples.

3. **Classification Exercise** (3 min): Show students various geometric figures and ask them to identify which are rays, segments, or lines.

### Assessment
- Can students correctly identify the endpoint of a ray?
- Can students distinguish between a ray and a segment based on visual representation?
- Can students use proper notation for each?
