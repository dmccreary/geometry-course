## About This MicroSim

This interactive tutorial demonstrates the classical compass and straightedge construction for bisecting an angle. Adjust the slider to try different starting angles.

## Construction Steps

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| **1** | Draw arc from B intersecting both rays at P and Q |
| **2** | Draw arc from P toward the interior |
| **3** | Draw arc from Q with same radius - find intersection D |
| **4** | Draw ray BD (the angle bisector) |
| **5** | Verify: ∠ABD ≅ ∠DBC |

## How to Use

1. **Adjust the slider** to change the original angle (40° to 140°)
2. **Click "Next"** to advance through steps
3. **Click "Auto"** to watch the full animation
4. **Click "Reset"** to start over

## Why It Works

The arcs from P and Q have equal radii, creating point D that is equidistant from both rays of the original angle. This ensures the bisector divides the angle exactly in half.

## Learning Objectives

- **Perform** angle bisection construction
- **Verify** that the two resulting angles are congruent
- **Apply** the construction to any angle

## Bloom's Taxonomy Level

**Applying** and **Evaluating** - Performing construction and verifying results.
