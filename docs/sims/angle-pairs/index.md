## Description

This MicroSim helps students understand the relationships between different types of angle pairs in geometry. Students can explore complementary angles (sum to 90°), supplementary angles (sum to 180°), vertical angles (opposite and equal), and adjacent angles (share a common side).

## Learning Objectives

Students will:

- **Identify** different types of angle pairs (complementary, supplementary, vertical, adjacent)
- **Understand** the mathematical relationships between angle measures
- **Apply** angle pair properties to solve for unknown angles
