## Description

This MicroSim presents a colorful visual diagram of the three undefined terms that form the foundation of geometry: **point**, **line**, and **plane**. These terms are called "undefined" because they are so fundamental that they cannot be defined using simpler concepts—instead, we understand them through experience and intuitive understanding.

The diagram displays three side-by-side panels, each illustrating one of these foundational concepts:

- **Point**: Shown as a position with no size, labeled with capital letters
- **Line**: Depicted as a straight path extending infinitely in both directions with no thickness
- **Plane**: Represented as a flat surface extending infinitely in all directions with no thickness

Each panel uses distinct background colors and includes multiple examples with proper geometric notation. The interactive checkbox allows students to toggle annotations on and off, helping them focus on the essential visual elements or dive deeper into the detailed properties of each term.

## Learning Objectives

Students will:

1. **Remember** the three undefined terms of geometry (point, line, plane) - *Bloom's Taxonomy: Remembering*
2. **Understand** their visual representations and basic properties - *Bloom's Taxonomy: Understanding*
3. **Recognize** proper geometric notation for naming points, lines, and planes
4. **Distinguish** between the three undefined terms based on their dimensional properties

## Lesson Plan

### Introduction (5 minutes)

1. Begin by asking students: "What is the simplest thing you can think of in geometry?"
2. Explain that geometry starts with three basic ideas that are so simple, we can't define them using other words—we just understand them
3. Introduce the concept of "undefined terms" as building blocks for all other geometric definitions

### Exploration (10 minutes)

1. Display the MicroSim and have students observe all three panels
2. Ask students to describe what they see in each panel
3. Use the annotation checkbox to show/hide additional information
4. Guide discussion on the dimensional properties:
   - Point: 0 dimensions (no length, width, or height)
   - Line: 1 dimension (length only, no width or height)
   - Plane: 2 dimensions (length and width, no height)

### Key Discussion Points

- **Naming Conventions**:
  - Points are named with single capital letters (A, B, C)
  - Lines are named by any two points on them (Line PQ or PQ with arrows)
  - Planes are named by any three non-collinear points (Plane XYZ)

- **"Undefined" Explanation**: These terms cannot be formally defined because:
  - Any definition would require simpler terms
  - These ARE the simplest terms in geometry
  - We understand them through spatial intuition and experience

### Practice Activities (10 minutes)

1. Have students identify points, lines, and planes in the classroom
2. Practice naming conventions:
   - Name 5 different points in the diagram
   - Identify two different ways to name the same line
   - Explain why three points must be non-collinear to define a plane

### Assessment Questions

1. What are the three undefined terms of geometry?
2. How many dimensions does each undefined term have?
3. Why are these terms called "undefined"?
4. How do we name each of these geometric objects?
5. Can you find examples of points, lines, and planes in the real world?

### Extension Activities

- Have students create their own diagrams showing examples of each undefined term
- Discuss why "three non-collinear points" are needed to define a plane (what would happen if all three points were on the same line?)
- Explore how these undefined terms combine to create defined terms (ray, line segment, angle, polygon, etc.)

## Grade Level

High School Geometry (Grades 9-12)

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of spatial relationships
- Familiarity with coordinate systems (helpful but not required)
- Basic algebra concepts

## Duration

Typical engagement time: 10-15 minutes for initial exploration and discussion

## Technical Implementation

This MicroSim is built using p5.js and features:

- Three responsive panels with color-coded backgrounds
- Clear geometric notation and labeling
- Interactive checkbox to toggle detailed annotations
- Educational callouts explaining key properties
- Visual representations that match standard geometry textbooks

## Standards Alignment

This MicroSim aligns with Common Core State Standards for Mathematics:

- **CCSS.MATH.CONTENT.HSG.CO.A.1**: Know precise definitions of angle, circle, perpendicular line, parallel line, and line segment, based on the undefined notions of point, line, distance along a line, and distance around a circular arc.

## Credits

Created using p5.js library for educational purposes in geometry instruction.
