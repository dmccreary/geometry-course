## About This MicroSim

This interactive diagram shows how every conditional statement has three related forms:

| Form | Definition | Notation |
|------|------------|----------|
| **Original** | If p, then q | p → q |
| **Converse** | If q, then p | q → p |
| **Inverse** | If not p, then not q | ~p → ~q |
| **Contrapositive** | If not q, then not p | ~q → ~p |

## Key Insight

**The contrapositive is ALWAYS logically equivalent to the original statement!**

If one is true, the other must be true. If one is false, the other must be false.

## How to Use

- **Hover** over any box to highlight its logically equivalent partner
- **Click "Next Example"** to cycle through different geometric statements
- Observe how truth values relate between equivalent statements

## Learning Objectives

- **Analyze** the relationships between conditional forms
- **Construct** converse, inverse, and contrapositive statements
- **Evaluate** which forms are logically equivalent

## Bloom's Taxonomy Level

**Analyzing** - Breaking down conditional statements into their related forms.
