## About This MicroSim

This interactive visualization demonstrates the **incenter** of a triangle - the intersection point of the three angle bisectors. The incenter is the center of the inscribed circle (incircle) that touches all three sides.

## Key Concepts

### Angle Bisectors
An **angle bisector** divides an angle into two equal parts. Every triangle has three angle bisectors, one from each vertex.

### The Incenter (I)
- The incenter is **always inside** the triangle (for any triangle type)
- It is **equidistant from all three sides**
- It is the center of the **incircle** (the largest circle that fits inside)

### Inradius Formula
The radius of the incircle can be calculated as:

$$r = \frac{\text{Area}}{s}$$

where $s$ is the semi-perimeter: $s = \frac{a + b + c}{2}$

## Interactions

- **Drag vertices** A, B, or C to reshape the triangle
- **Watch** how the incircle always touches all three sides
- **Observe** the tangent points where the incircle meets each side

## Learning Objectives

- Understand that angle bisectors meet at a single point
- Identify the incenter as equidistant from all sides
- Recognize that the incircle touches all three sides
- Apply the inradius formula: r = Area / s
