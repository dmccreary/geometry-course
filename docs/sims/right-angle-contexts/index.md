## About This MicroSim

This interactive diagram shows how right angles (90°) appear in everyday objects. Hover over each panel to learn why right angles are important in that context.

## Real-World Examples

| Example | Why Right Angles Matter |
|---------|------------------------|
| Book Corner | Proper binding and stacking |
| Street Intersection | Safe navigation and visibility |
| Picture Frame | Holds pictures properly |
| Geometric Notation | Standard mathematical representation |

## How to Use

- **Hover** over each panel to see a description
- Notice the **right angle marker** (small square) in each illustration
- See how the same 90° angle appears in different contexts

## The Right Angle Marker

In geometry, we mark right angles with a **small square** at the vertex instead of a curved arc. This tells you immediately that the angle measures exactly 90° without needing to write the measurement.

## Learning Objectives

- **Recognize** right angles in everyday contexts
- **Apply** geometric knowledge to real-world situations
- **Identify** the right angle symbol

## Bloom's Taxonomy Level

**Applying** - Recognizing mathematical concepts in new situations.
