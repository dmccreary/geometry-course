## About This Diagram

This diagram shows the three classifications of triangles based on the relationships among their side lengths.

## Triangle Types by Sides

| Type | Definition | Properties |
|------|------------|------------|
| **Scalene** | All three sides different lengths | No equal angles |
| **Isosceles** | Two sides equal (congruent) | Base angles are equal |
| **Equilateral** | All three sides equal | All angles are 60° |

## Visual Markers

- **Tick marks** on sides indicate congruent (equal) sides
- **Arc marks** at angles indicate congruent angles
- Side lengths are labeled in centimeters

## Key Facts

- An equilateral triangle is a special type of isosceles triangle
- Every triangle falls into exactly one of these categories

## Interaction

Click on any triangle panel to highlight that type and dim the others.

## Learning Objectives

- **Remember** the three classifications by sides
- **Understand** the relationship between equal sides and equal angles

## Bloom's Taxonomy Level

**Remembering** and **Understanding** - Terminology introduction.
