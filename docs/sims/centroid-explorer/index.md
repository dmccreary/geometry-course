## About This MicroSim

This interactive visualization demonstrates the **centroid** of a triangle - the intersection point of the three medians. The centroid is also known as the "center of mass" or "balance point" of the triangle.

## Key Concepts

### Medians
A **median** is a line segment connecting a vertex to the midpoint of the opposite side. Every triangle has exactly three medians.

### The Centroid (G)
- The centroid is always located **inside** the triangle
- It divides each median in a **2:1 ratio** from vertex to midpoint
- It is the **balance point** where the triangle would balance on a pin

### The 2:1 Property
Click on any median to see the 2:1 ratio visualization:
- The distance from the vertex to the centroid is **twice** the distance from the centroid to the midpoint
- This property holds for all three medians in any triangle

## Interactions

- **Drag vertices** A, B, or C to reshape the triangle
- **Click on a median** to highlight it and see the 2:1 ratio
- Watch how the centroid position changes as you modify the triangle

## Learning Objectives

- Understand that medians connect vertices to opposite midpoints
- Identify the centroid as the intersection of the three medians
- Recognize that the centroid is always inside the triangle
- Apply the 2:1 ratio property of medians
