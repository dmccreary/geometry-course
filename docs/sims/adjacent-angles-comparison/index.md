## About This MicroSim

This visualization shows three examples that clarify what makes angles adjacent. Hover over each panel to see the requirements checklist.

## Requirements for Adjacent Angles

| Requirement | Must Have? |
|-------------|------------|
| Common vertex | Yes |
| Common side | Yes |
| No overlap | Yes |

## Three Examples

1. **Adjacent** - Share vertex B and side BC
2. **NOT Adjacent** - Different vertices (P and Q)
3. **NOT Adjacent** - Same vertex but no common side

## Key Insight

Just having a common vertex is NOT enough! The angles must also share a common side (ray) between them.

## Learning Objectives

- **Identify** adjacent angles by checking requirements
- **Distinguish** adjacent from non-adjacent angle pairs
- **Understand** both requirements must be met

## Bloom's Taxonomy Level

**Understanding** and **Analyzing** - Identifying and classifying angle relationships.
