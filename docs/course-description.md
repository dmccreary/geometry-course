# Geometry

**Title:** Geometry

**Target Audience:**
High school students (grades 9–10) who have successfully completed Algebra I or an equivalent introductory algebra course.

**Prerequisites:**

* Algebra I
* Comfort with basic equations, graphing, and logical reasoning
* Curiosity about shapes, patterns, and spatial relationships

## Course Summary

Geometry is the art and science of **shapes, space, and structure** — from the perfect symmetry of snowflakes to the soaring arcs of bridges.
In this course, you’ll explore the elegant rules that govern our visual world and learn how to reason like a mathematician.

Through a blend of **interactive simulations (MicroSims)**, **hands-on geometric constructions**, and **real-world design challenges**, you’ll discover how geometric ideas explain both natural forms and human-made creations — from honeycombs to roller coasters, from kaleidoscopes to architecture.

You’ll use **dynamic geometry tools** and **visual MicroSims** to:

* Move shapes and watch how transformations preserve (or change) them.
* Explore triangles, circles, and solids in 3D.
* Model real-world objects like ramps, wheels, or prisms.
* Use coordinate geometry to bridge algebra and geometry.

By the end of the course, you’ll not only know **why** geometric relationships are true — you’ll be able to **prove** them and **use them creatively** to solve meaningful design and modeling problems.
